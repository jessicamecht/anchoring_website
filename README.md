# Testing effects on anchoring bias with user-personalized re-sampling 

This repository contains code for displaying different orders of 

1. Displaying random sequences to viewers
2. Displaying sequences to users that have been heuristically sampled, e.g. showing good and bad files alternately
3. Displaying sequences to users that are sampled based on their previous anchoring behavior, learned with an LSTM and re-sampled using reinforcement learning.
