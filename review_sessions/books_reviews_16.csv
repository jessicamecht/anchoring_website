25432,"Seabiscuit: An American Legendwas written in 2001. At the tim I considered it the best book I had read in ten years. Over ten years later, Ms. Hildebrand delivers Unbroken. Like Seabiscuit is is meticulously researched, and a tale of athletic achievement in the face of adversity. Ms. Hildebrand who suffers from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome knows a bit about adversity. Nothing in her life experience prepares her for the recounting of the tale of Louis Zamperini, a California kid who by learning to run escaped a lifetime of petty crime. The running took him to the 1936 Olympics, and to the University of Southern California. But like many of his generation the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor produced a career change. Zamperini ended up as a B-24 bombardier in the Pacific Theatre.Shot down during a search and rescue mission, Zamperini and two survivors (one died on the raft)  drifted into Japanese held territory for 47 days. Following that ordeal came another, life in brutal Japanese POW camps where he was tormented incessantly by a crazed sergeant nicknamed ""The Bird"".It is, however,  after the war that Zamperini's real test begins. Spiraling out of control into alcoholism and depression an encounter with Billy Graham changed his life as profoundly as anything that had come before it.This is not Seabiscuit. There are aspects of this book which are truly horrifying. Sections on survival at sea and in POW camps are difficult. At the end however the book like Zamperini is redeemed. While it ia not the best book I have read in the past ten years, it teaches important lessons about duty, sacrifice, endurance and of course redemption.",Redemption,5.0

Ok, her signs were not perfect but I knew what she was talking about.  Learning signs has really helped with her communicating with us. I am so glad she learned the signs. Now, at 2 years old, she talks and uses the signs to help us understand.",Baby knew all the signs by one year old,5.0

18998,"I decided a long time ago that I wouldn't review a book unless I had something new to add, but the negative reviews I've read of Wolf Hall here on the Amazon site have changed my mind in this particular case. You know that old chestnut by Mark Twain that the right word is the difference between lightning and a lightning bug? This entire book is an electrical storm. Mantel's use of language is nothing short of astonishing and Wolf Hall is on my very short list of the best books I've ever read, period.",One of the best books I've ever read.,5.0

53425,"Iam an adult and considered giving this story as a gift for a younger person.  I have decided to keep it and add it to my other Mark Moulton books.  I will purchase several more for the little ones.  This is the story, in poem, of how Clement Moore came to write THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS.  The story is mesmerizing but the art is more than special.  Each very large page is beautifully illustrated by Susan Winget.  Every page could be framed because they are so artfully done.  At the end is the illustration of Clement Moore's handwritten offering of The Night Before Christmas dated 1862, one year before his death, along with his signature.  What a wonderful gift to a child, to read Christmas Eve, in lieu of just the Santa poem.  Iam deeply satisfied with this book and am happy to add it to my bookcase.  The only thing better would be a signed copy.  Any book-loving adult will treasure this book.",Magnificent offering,5.0
28672,This was really a great trilogy - one suggestion - make sure you read the 2nd book immediately following the first or you'll have to go back and read the last chapter of Sanctus again. I truly loved all three books.,Great Trilogy,5.0
