195,2,"You most definitely get what you pay for, these are very cheap and have already started to show signs of rusting after just a couple of months.  Also look carefully at the fork and knife, they are shaped quite differently than a regular set.  The fork also bends pretty easily which is not good when trying to eat a steak.  The spoons are also very disproportionate if you look at the little spoon it is way smaller than it appears in the picture.  I hate to say it but I was not impressed with Ikea in this case. I had to buy a whole new set to replace this one.",You get what you pay for
247,1,Not for me. It's so small (of course) and it's really only good for nuts. It pulverizes other products. I returned it with no problem.,mini-prep processor
2,4,"There is no shortage of pop recipes available for free on the web, but I purchased the ""Zoku Quick Pops"" book, because Zoku has some good recipes for fruit pops on its blog. I was hoping there were more where those came from. This book emphasizes very sweet dessert pops, however. There are 41 recipes in total, only 13 of which are fruit pops. There is a ""Fresh and Fruity"" chapter, followed by three chapters of dessert pops entitled ""I Scream for Quick Pops!"", ""Bake Shop"", and  ""Coco Loco"". As you might guess from the last one, there are 15 pop recipes that contain chocolate.Chapters on ""Tips"" and ""Techniques"" are useful. There is more detailed information about ingredients that don't freeze well in the Zoku than is found in the instruction manual. The book lists options for dairy products and sweeteners, tells you how to do different types of layers, how to add decorative fruit slices, how to do a quick shell, and how to make core pops. The pages about core pops are especially helpful, as they include recipes for pink, purple, and orange outer layers for brightly-colored core pops. The book recommends using Zoku accessory kits, but you can do without.The pop recipes tend to go out of their way to be as sweet as possible. Many, including the recipe for a vanilla base, call for vanilla pudding, where vanilla Greek yogurt would do just as well. I've substituted it with no ill effect. On the bright side, many of these recipes may appeal to children, whereas most pop books that I have seen are geared more to adults. There are flavors like ""Cookie Dough"", ""That's a S'more"", chocolate peanut butter, and peanut butter and jelly. All 9 recipes in ""Bake Shop"" are inspired by cake and cookie recipes.As a resource for light, fresh-tasting fruit pop recipes, ""Zoku Quick Pops"" is very limited. Most of the fruit recipes are gimmicky and contain too many ingredients. The recipe for Lemonade pops contains orange juice, which is fine, but the addition of vanilla extract kills the fresh fruit flavor. The recipe for mango pops includes orange, apple, banana and lemon, which are too many competing flavors. Mango and orange together make a terrific pop. The book is great for chocolate lovers and those looking for dessert pop recipes. Tips and techniques are also useful. For fruit pop recipes, ""Top Pops"" by Emily Zaiden is far better.","Excels at Sweet Dessert Pops, but Falls Short on the Fruit Pops."
225,1,"Can't chop anything well.  [Tried onions, tomatoes, celery, olives, nuts, and many other items.]  Tried 2, 4, and 8-oz loads.  Tried 1/8, 1/4, 1/2 cup loads.All you get is half mush and the other half ""as is"".I think it could ""mix"" 1/4 cup of cooked rice with a 1/2 cup of water ... but who needs that?This will be the last Cuisinart product I'll buy; their griddler, blender, and ice cream maker are poorly engineered too ... and I long ago stopped using them.","It's A Joke, Right?"
10,4,The recipes in this books are tedious to make. I found that easier and simpler recipes can be found online. I had no problem with the recipes online working in the Zoku maker.,"I liked this book, but........"
8,5,"The Zoku accessories are pricey, but the recipes have the exact amount you need to make the pops.  I have made it through 15 varieties so far, and I like them all.","If you have the Zoku maker, buy this!"
1,5,I bought this zoku quick pop for my daughterr with her zoku quick maker. She loves it and have fun to make her own ice cream.,zoku
243,1,This processor does not work.  This was a replacement for a Krupps processor and I only used it 3 times.  I had to buy a Phillips to replace it.,Does not work
6,5,"This book is so beautifully illustrated and easy to follow. It helps you to understand the Zoku better. It might have been even better if they made the recipe units for different sized molds. These recipes produce too much for a single mold unit. It would have been nice if they used a matrix for the ingredients like on a box of rice. I am just math lazy and bought a single mold Zoku. Dividing 3/4 of a cup, 3 tablespoons or 3 1/2 tablespoons is kind of dicey in my kitchen.",Beautifully illustrated recipe and instruction book for Zoku pops
115,3,"These are really cute, for the pattern. I have bought a few of these to carry birthday presents for my kids friends. They are good for lightweight use, and the Star Wars design is adorable. But as far as grocery store use / everyday use, they are not that strong of bags. TRU sells them around $3-4 each and they are just about as good enough for carrying light stuff and toys, but no heavy use or day to day use here.","Cute design, but not good for long term use."
232,1,"This is okay for chopping cilantro, but does not puree very well. I my mind it does not live up to the Cuisinart name. Much prefer my old Sunbeam Oskar.",Okay
264,2,I thought it would be great. I have Black & Decker that does a better job. It also has a small prep bowl. My big Cuisinart broke so I thought for a small size it would be good. Did not even crush wet beans or move it to the top as said. It was to late for me to return it.,Disappointed
287,1,"Then go with the Ninja Master Prep. I bought both and the Cusinart turned an onion into mush. When i tried to just pulse it the pieces were very inconsistant, so I pulsed a littlemore and it turned it to mush. On the New Ninja Master Prep. It has only pulse one speed, but its more powerful and the mini base has four blades, two like the cusinart and two more above them so if you put a half an onion in and give it one short pulse your done. I had to chop garlic the Ninja chopped it up perfectly. Its more money than the mini cusinart but its a muchbetter unit.",Does a terrible job of chopping if your looking for a good one
194,2,"The small spoon is too small. The bigger spoon is too big. Neither of them are true &#34;teaspoon&#34; size spoons. The flatware is very thin so the knife really has no cutting power (even for a butter knife) behind it. HOWEVER, for the price I paid, I can't expect anything else. They are pretty stylish at a glance but if you're looking to do anything that requires a durable utensil, this isn't the one you want.",Eh.
7,2,"I bought this when I bought the pop maker. I think the recipes are fine, but there really isn't much in the book I wouldn't have figured out myself.A couple of good creamy recipes that are now available for free on recipe websites. As for ""pop embellishing"" well, that wasn't too hard to figure out, either. I'd save the money and spend it instead on extra pop sticks, which seem to disappear the way socks do....",Okay but you can figure it out yourself without the book
30,4,"This lesson plan is perfect for a beginner and definitely helped introduce working with fondant in a user-friendly way.  Thanks, Wilton.",Great
120,1,"I did sloppy shopping. This machine is exactly what the name says it is - a speller. I wanted definitions, OH, that would be a dictionary! I ordered a dictionary an I am happy - except the voice is scratchy. Life is not perfect.gg",Sprelling Only
216,2,"While this is a cute tin box (and I used it to hold mini-muffins at at baby shower), it isn't meant to be used.  Would look cute as a decoration in a baby's room or to hold all those crayon's for an older child.",More decoration than useful
139,1,"I'm very disappointed in this device. It's basically just a coat hanger with two plastic guides.  The only thing it has going for it is portability.  It can only hold regular sized hard covered books. Forget about any size paperback, it will not work. Even hard cover books are nearly impossible to align correctly and they slip and slump in all kinds of odd positions.  Then you have to completely remove the book from the stand every time you need to turn a page and try to realign it all over again.  I tried with over 10 textbooks and it didn't do well with any of them.  For home reading I'm going to buy and suggest you buy a more substantial stand. The only reason to keep it is to slip in a backpack and take with you and hope you have the desk space wherever you take it to use it.",It is basically just a coat hanger
9,5,"High quality book. Clear and helpful information, and then some superb recipe suggestions clearly outlined. I can highly recommend this product.",Satisfaction opinion
29,4,"I have always wanted to learn how to decorate a beautiful cake, and I purchased this guidebook along with The Wilton Pastry bag kit.  I appreciate how this guide gives tips on how to bake the perfect cake, and also gives detailed step-by-step instructions on how to use the pastry bag to make many different designs. I do, however, agree that this book did appear to be an advertisment for thier products, but the guide was helpful nonetheless.",Great For Beginners!
13,5,"This is the story of a group of butterflies looking for a place to sleep. Each one is a different color, and each pair of facing pages (color-coordinated, of course!) tells the story of where each of the butterflies found to sleep. Each of the butterflies is shown as a brightly-colored, foil-looking toy that your little one will not be able to resist touching.My little one absolutely loved this book, and it did go great as a preparing for sleep read. The colors and the butterflies, and the cute story all were a hit. We both highly recommend this book!",My little one absolutely loved this book
98,3,"Note, this is a small booklet..not a book. It's maybe 6 inches tall by 4 inches wide and about 15 pages. The pages are in color.It's not bad but I would not pay more than $3 for it.",You get what you pay for...kinda
22,4,helpful information on decoraing basics. Good book for beginners who need step by step instructions and guidance. Good for all age groups.,This is a good book for anyone interested in cake decorating.
41,4,"A good tool for home use.  Shows several types of simple, easy to perform techniques.  Would recommend for beginners and home bakers.",Good for beginners
94,3,"This ""book"" is more like a brochure.. or one of those checkout cookbooks. It does have some basic tips in it but I surely wouldn't pay more than $5 for it!!",Not what I was expecting
83,3,Itr was fine  I was hoping for more  but it was as promisedI was purchased as a gift and they enjoy it,I hoped for more
32,3,"It took me about 40 minutes to read this lesson plan thoroughly; while it is inexpensive at under five dollars, I still don't know if that is necessarily a good value. As some reviewers have pointed out, much of the book focuses on advertising Wilton products; without all of this the useful material in the book could have been condensed down to a couple of pages. I did like the photographs and the techniques for making different consistencies of buttercream for different uses. I had initially planned on getting the subsequent lesson plans as well, but I don't think it will be worth it. If you have any skill/experience with cake decorating at all, I'd recommend skipping this book.",Okay
45,3,"This book is okay, but I was expecting a much larger book than this. This book is the size of my hand and hard to see the small writing when you're trying to prepare and read it at the same time.",Disappointed again!
28,4,This book isn't much help if you are not taking the wilton cake decorating classes. you can get the basics but its really just a visual for the class!,good if you take a class!
285,1,"The blade mechanism on this chopper is extremely difficult to remove or adjust.  I have very small fingers, and there is still barely enough room between the two blades for me to press on the plastic ring to remove it.  I can't imagine how someone with large fingers would manage.  My husband and I both sliced our fingers numerous times the first time we assembled this and tried to change the blade position, so I read the manual to see if we were doing it wrong.  Well, the diagram in the manual doesn't correspond to the actual machine, so it's useless.On top of the danger, it doesn't even do that good of a job chopping.  There's nothing I can do in this thing that I can't do better and more easily with my hand-held blender.  Save your money AND your fingers!  Steer clear of this thing!",finger-slicing death trap
4,4,"This cookbook is great.  I have really enjoyed reviewing all of the recipes.  Sure - some are more difficult than others, but there is a nice variety in this book.  For me it was totally worth it just to get the quick shell recipes alone.  We have only tried the chocolate so far, but it is so tasty.  A few of my favorite recipes in this book are the banana from the strawberry banana one, and the raspberry/blackberry ones (but I used mixed berries).  Also, it has great instructions for tips on using the Zoku.  Definitely recommended.",A must own if you own the Zoku maker...
48,4,"I saw this book at Target and flipped through it.  I was amazed at all the ideas to do with a simple brownie!  Granted what I make won't ever look as good as the pictures in the book, but I'm okay with that.  If I had sat down and thought about it I might have come up with some of these same ideas, but some of them are really clever.  I have had fun looking through the book with my kids and we are making brownie pops for my son's b'day treats at school and his party.PROS:- You can buy most of these supplies (including the book) at Michael's Craft Supplies or Joann's and like I said, I saw the book at Target with some of the molds.- creative uses for brownies.  Great way to have an easy-to-make but fun treats for all sorts of occasions.- there are suggestions for b'day's, sports, holidays, gifts...CONS:- You need to buy the molds or supplies to make any of special shapes so it's an investment up front.  Once you have them it's all about Brownie Fun!I think this book is a great resource (or a fun gift!) for any parent or person who likes to bake and be creative.",Great for kids or as a gift for a baker
11,5,"This beautifully illustrated book featuring ten colorful,glittery butterflies is a favorite at our house. The nana-babies like to count the butterflies as they flit off! The book is also good for learning colors, discussing the activities the butterflies do and the plastic butterflies are great as the babies and toddlers like to touch them!",A sweet book for babies and toddlers
244,1,"received in good conditon, had to return the first one,  did not chop,  got the second one, it was for my daughter she said it did not work well",chopper
5,5,"If you have a Zoku Quick Pop maker (or two....I have the original one-slot and then I bought the double-slot here at Amazon), I recommend you get this creative little book, which will inspire you.",Love it
0,5,My daughter wanted this book and the price on Amazon was the best.  She has already tried one recipe a day after receiving the book.  She seems happy with it.,Best Price
234,2,"My original mini prep had a sharp blade, not a serrated blade.  I got years of use out of it, and I wouldn't have replaced it but my husband mistakenly through the lid out in the trash.  This one is only so so, and food gets caught in the teeth of the serrated blade",Nowhere as nice as my original miniprep
26,2,didn't really care many of the cakes at all. not up to normal standing for wilton yearbooks of the past. the best cake is on the cover.,not the best
12,5,I got this as a gift for my niece and she loved it. It's a super cute book and ill be getting it for any other nieces that may come along.,Super cute niece present
96,3,"This is an ok book for a new cake decorator. It recovers a lot of the stuff already covered in the instruction booklets (beginning cake decorating and flowers and borders) and gives some full cake ideas.I like the instructions and have been using them as a supplement to the instruction books to have ideas of decorations to practice. However, the cakes themselves are nothing super exciting.This is the sort of book you buy when you're starting out and use until you have the skills down pretty well - then you would probably never use it again. I just can't see myself pulling this book out for ""cake decorating ideas"" when there are so many better idea books out there.Honestly, if you weren't getting this on a 4-for-3 promotion or it was on sale for about 10 bucks I wouldn't bother with it.","Ok, but nothing super exciting"
67,3,"I bought this and the 2012 a the same time, only to realise half the book has the same info. It's more a catalog than a book of ideas. It does have some picture but it is basically the same as the 2012 year. It has a couple of recipes, but the are the same on both the yearbooks.I bought it because I wanted to learn how to make things with a step-by-step guide. It is not that.",First time buying a Wilton yearbook. Won't do it again
27,4,I am very happy I purchased this book as it containes so much great information and time saving tips. I highly recommend.,good tips
21,3,"So I actually bought this thinking it was the entire Lesson 2 kit. However, I've found through experience that having the book without having to take the class is a good thing. I've taken the Wilton Lesson 1 class and the number of Wilton items you have to purchase ALONG with the Lesson kit is a little ridiculous. I've worked my way through Lesson 1 and now I'm working my way (by myself) through lesson 2. I recommend anyone that likes to work on their own time to just purchase this book.",Good for what it's worth
109,2,Bag tore with almost nothing in it - Just caught the corner of a small cracker box and that was that. Pretty disappointed.,Tore rather easily
3,5,"This book is a must have if you get a Zoku (which I also highly recommend). There is a large variety of recipes from simple, to fancy. The flavor combos are creative, and it gives you ideas for decorating the pops too. They turn out as beautiful as they are tasty. After reading it you will be inspired to create your own recipes too.",Creative Combos
265,2,"This is my very first mini processor, i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose,small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However, i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it, used on HI as recommended, many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly, i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before, and the texture turn out perfect, just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy.",Litte dissapointed after the first use
151,2,"I'm very disappointed with this purchase. The quality of the product is low, the paint is uneven and the bottom of the cup is cheeped.",Ugly and of poor quality
275,1,"I purchased this in advance for what I knew was going to be a lot of food prep Labor Day Weekend.I was so certain of the Cuisinart brand name that I threw out the boxes and other packaging and the damned thing didn't work.  Well, it worked for 10 seconds and then died.  It was probably the single biggest waste of $30 I have ever made and the entire thing ended up in the trash and I spent 4 hours chopping vegetables by hand.",It is Junk
95,3,"I'm not expert baker but, the video was very basic. I want to learn how to decorate a cakeand I think they focused to much on the basics then teaching how to actually decorate the cakeand maybe show more examples of her decorating. not bad, but if you are looking for something more advance onactually decorating a cake. this is not for you. but if you are new to baking, this is perfect for you!",very basic!
