106,5.0,I appreciate getting the book at the great price.  I'm really not complaining but the book was quite yellow and the jacket was torn in various places.  It looked like it was on the shelf for quite a while........Maureen,adequate
309,5.0,This book was a quick read and a creative idea. But it was dry. It could and should have been elaborated on. It seemed as though the author was bored with writing it. Granted there were times of strong emotion but for the most part it was just lacking in all aspects.,"Overrated, dry"
143,5.0,One of the classics that everyone should read. It is also one of the most profound books that is this short.,great
500,5.0,I couldn't really get into the book.  Still have not seen the movie either but to me the book starts out slow and I hate books like that,Okay
141,5.0,"As he (the ""prophet"") awaits the ship that will return him to his home country after fourteen years of being absent, he begins providing answers in colorful parables to questions raised by the occupants of the city he has temporarily made his home.  We follow this spiritual man as the loving townspeople seek him out for wisdom.  There is ultimately great sadness when he departs.I would describe these writings as poetic, philosophic prose for daily spiritual living.  There are many sound words, with a relaxed style, and a somewhat universalistic belief.  It is okay.Lord's blessingsScott","Poetic, philosophic prose"
553,5.0,"I am going to be a bad person right now and say that I do not understand the big hype for this book. I liked it, it was interesting, and I think that carnivals during the Depression are a popular theme in some recent entertainment (Carnivale, The Night Circus), and I can see why.  This book is entertaining but it is not particularly deep or special.  I listened to some of it on audio and that absolutely added to the story.",the audio version was more resonant
385,4.0,got the sample for my kindle and loved it.  bought it.  then it got raunchy.  alot of bad language and vulgar descriptions.  I just wish all that had been in the sample so I wouldn't have wasted my money buying the book!,total let down
668,5.0,"Interesting book that makes you want to keep reading, but in the end, it seems like the author tried too hard to wrap things up and make everyone happy.I find that the best way to make reviews helpful is by adding a list of books I love and books I hated. That way you can compare and determine whether you and I have similar tastes. So here is my list:Books I love or at at least really, really like:We Need to Talk about Kevin.Tell the Wolves I'm HomeWhen the Emperor Was DivineThe History of HistoryThe Remains of the DayWe Have Always Lived in the CastleThe Night CircusWater for ElephantsThe Sisters BrothersThe Poisonwood BibleBooks I REALLY hated:The Bear in a Muddy Tutu1Q84The Buddha of SuburbiaA Visit from the Goon SquadSun StormA Long Way DownWhen We Were OrphansThe Haunting of Hill House","Interesting story and characters, but the ending is too &#34;Disney-like&#34;"
743,1.0,"The book is a good book but in no way great.  The descriptions of the time period and the circus was great but the story was predictable to excess.  The characters were contrived and stereotypical.  I did enjoy parts of the story but it is not a great novel, it is merely an entertaining read.",Good not great
69,5.0,"As Amin Rihani described his own friend Gibran, Gibran's style of writing is just &#34;mawkish sentimentalism&#34;. Yes, sentimentalism, and that is all Gibran is all about. For most Americans' taste, this guy is just pasty! And who can stomach that!","Pasty, pasty! Too much!"
561,3.0,"Gruen not only tells a good story about the early circus trains, but she also uses her research to add credibility.  Her sophisticated style and vocabulary make for pleasurable reading.",Finally a Good Novel
192,5.0,"How people can make these types of mistakes is beyond me. There appears to have been no editor or proofreading before putting this up for sale and apparently no quailty control measures on Amazon's part. The problems:1. 4,500 locations or 450 pages are missing. This ebook is 500 locations or 50 pages.2. The reviews posted on the &#34;Kindle Store&#34; were clearly for the hard copy version3.  This &#34;book&#34; give a page or two &#34;outline&#34; of a topic. Example- there is no information detailing the seven churches like in the hard copy version just a 2 page turn &#34;outline&#34; saying the Book of Revelations speaks about seven churches.4. Complete information is just missing. The table of content looks consistent with the hard copy version yet once you spend $3.99 to buy it and click on a TOC link subtiles are not there.5. This ebook is just a very brief overview of what is in the Book of Revelations and what is in Larkin's actual book.I will be getting a refund from Amazon.","Dont buy for Kindle 4,500 locations missing (450 pages)!"
212,4.0,I didn't realize this was the children's book in the Dr. Seuss series. I thought it was for adults. My mistake and I had to laugh at myself when I excitedly opened it up. I couldn't teach my dog any new tricks! :),My mistake
441,5.0,I dislike strange sexual behavior but most of all I hate killing and mistreatment of animals and other humans.  I just didn't look into the book far enough to realize these things were written about.,water for elephants not for me
238,5.0,"I love the Berenstain Bears, but this book stinks.  This is the only book of theirs that I rank low.  I grew up with the Berenstein Bear's books and love their illustrations and messages, but this one lacks in content and craftsmanship.  Buy every other Berenstein Bear book out there but skip this one.",Only stinker the Berenstein Bears ever laid.
244,5.0,"I wanted to like this book, but I expected a lot, and found it a disappointment.  The first half about Grania's struggles with learning how to communicate and trying to fit in with her family and friends was interesting and new perspective, even though a bit slow at times and not always that compelling.  As far as the second half, I have read other books that have dealt with the horrors of WWI, and this one offered not one new perspective or new point of view or descriptions.  I didn't see how it added to the story at all, and at this point in the book I really wished I wasn't reading it, but I guess some part of me wanted to find out what happened, and I felt that the ending was a let down.  Mostly, I feel that this topic could have been really, really engrossing, new, and compelling, but the book's lackluster plot and storytelling left me flat.  I won't recommend this book.",A disappointment
630,4.0,"This book had its moments, I cried and I smiled.  However there was a lot in between those moments that I ended up just glossing over.  I find that the book is normally better than the movie so I'm glad I read the book instead of watching the movie.  I don't think I could have sat for the whole movie.",Just okay
732,5.0,started off great...didn't care for it as it went on. The animal abuse really bothered me and I really didn't like the way it ended...sorry....,started off great
349,4.0,I was looking for a good read and after seeing the high marks this book received I thought I couldn't go wrong. I put it down halfway thru and only picked it back up because I paid for it. I read alot and I just don't get the extreme praise this book racked up.,Over rated book...
392,5.0,The concept of this book was interesting to me but this book is boring. The characters are one dimensional and the main character is lame. I decided not to finish it after reading other reviews that say it is a waste of time (I got about half way through).,Boring Characters
677,5.0,"Life's a bitch and then you get old and it's worse and then you die.  That's all you need to know, which is a good thing because this novel has left me too depressed to write any more.",tedious
173,4.0,"The news of the death of Beryl Bainbridge last year made me want to read books by a very accomplished writer. In our book club we chose to read Master Georgie.This was a great disappointment. We should have asked for advice on what books to read. The book was nominated for the Booker prize in 1998, but did not win the award.While there is an interesting historical episode as the background, and there were different viewpoints, the reader never feels that this is a book that must be read. At times it seemed disjointed. There were narratives from different characters, but that style did not feel the gaps. Different narratives normally means the reader gets an insight into an event from different perspectives. This did not happen.So need to read other books to appreciate the greatness of Beryl Bainbridge",A Sisappointment
272,5.0,"I wanted to like this book; however, the reality was the writing was sub-par (it reminded me of a a middle or high school essay on what I did over the Summer) and the characters nor the plot were rich enough to hold my attention.",Lower your expectations.
718,5.0,"Everyone was talking about it last summer, and my book club decided to read it. I was very disappointed. Characters were not believable, there was too much cruelty to animals and violence here, nobody I really liked except the dwarf, and the back and forth from the young man to the nursing home got very dreary. I skipped a lot of pages because the early part was so boring.",Disappointment
570,5.0,"So much has already been written about the shallow characters and implausible ending... So no need to belabor that point.However, I do want to throw up a Red Flag to those readers who, like me, aren't big fans of profanity. I listened to Water for Elephants on CD and found myself cringing repeatedly at the author's liberal use of the F-word. (And many other words.) Furthermore, the graphic sexuality felt like the author's attempt to titillate and shock her readers with needless cheap thrills. She provided ample details regarding the sexual habits of her characters whilst omitting more relevant ones regarding central relationships and motives.There was an interesting storyline in there somewhere. As to the rest, it could've been toned down.","Sensitive readers, beware..."
448,4.0,"I expected more substance, but it's not there.  Still, reasonably well written and easily read--like (or with) a light pinot grigio.",Lightweight
694,5.0,"Water for Elephants is a fun read. It's not a profound work, but as entertainment, it works well. I really admire the detail and characterization. My favorite character? The elephant.",Entertaining
726,5.0,"The prologue to this book put me off a little, containing as it did a very descriptive act of violence, but I persevered since someone had recommended this book to me.  Two more very ugly, explicit and disgusting sexualized ""scenes"" in the very early pages had me deleting the whole thing and not reading any further.  I'm told this has been made into a movie, which not only beggars belief, but illustrates why I rarely find a movie these days that is worth watching.",Not my choice!
484,5.0,I really wish publishers would rate books like they do movies.  I got to the porn part and once again threw another book in the trash unfinished.  Problem is these books are good and the authors don't need to put the trashy parts in - they choose to.  Garbage in - Garbage out.  Guard your heart and your mind don't buy this book. Buy something else or wait for the PG version.,CAUTION - PORN PARTS!!!
112,5.0,"This is classic reading, which I did read when it was &#34;young&#34;.I was glad to find it available for Kindle.",The Prophet
256,5.0,"I am continually puzzled by the publishing industry's ""prizes.""  This book takes up an astonishing amount of shelf space in book stores.  Cover to cover there is nothing in it.  It is like reading a cut and paste book.  The characters are thin, flavorless, cliched, sleep-inducing.  The same with the dialogue.  I am still trying to determine what the author's purpose was, unless it was to bore us to tears (those would be the only tears shed).  I felt like it was written by an automaton, someone who does not care about the craft of writing but thinks she is precious.  There is no strength to the story or the sentences.  I actually felt insulted by this drivel.Read The Deptford Trilogy, by Robertson Davies.  Now there is a circus story you won't forget.",Now I lay me down to sleep
525,2.0,"I thought this book would be outstanding by all the really good reviews it got. But I only read about 3 1/2 chapters and called it quits. I just thought it was very dull reading. I thought perhaps, I would try again at some point to read it..but after thinking about that idea for a while--I decided that I wouldn't try reading it again. I will say I was disappointed; I will also say I would not suggest to anyone to read this book.  :(",I read the reviews..
176,5.0,"I was attracted to this mesmerizing novel by its meditations on 19th century photography, Victorian middle-class hypocrisy and the Crimean War. Photography binds this brief novel together and Bainbridge revels in its  historical and metaphorical possibilities. She organizes her chapters  around photographs, which makes the reader immediately aware that she/he is  to infer meaning from this practice and speculate on the role of  photography in determing what and how we see and remember. Bainbridge is  very sensitive to and aware of 19th century photography: its use during the  Crimean War (the first war that photographs were taken of), connection to  both science and magic, and the practice of post-mortem photography. The  reader does have to work to explore the themes suggested by the author, but  her historical grounding, lucid prose and rich subject make the effort  worthwhile.",photography and history
127,5.0,"You've got to be kidding, all you 5 star reviewers!  This overly sentimental trash is sickening! It just rambles on and on with nonsense. It is said that Gibran is a great poet. Really? It has no poetic value whatsoever. Save your $2, my friend, and if you're looking for enlightenment try &#34;Siddhartha&#34;.","Pompous, Pretentious, Platitudes"
560,3.0,I did not like the language or the story. I have not finished the the book and have no interest in doing so,Not finished
758,3.0,"Fell in love with the characters!  Although I didn't research the story, it felt very real & could possibly be historically correct about circus'.  This was a page turner... real almost in one sitting.  Now I need to see the movie!",Excellent story
23,2.0,"I read this about a year ago and can't recall a great deal of the book. From what I do recall it was like a poem all the way through. While the writing was beautiful, I found it ambiguous and befuddled with meaning that I could not identify with. When Gibran speaks of God, I cannot identify because I have since abandoned those philosophies. It is thus difficult to revisit them in this book. I have the feeling a may have missed something great about this book. Indeed, I pulled wisdom from parts, but rather than go back and read it again, for now, perhaps I will move on to another of the many books out there that are enlightening and worth reading. Someday, I would like to read this again and dig deeper.",Eloquent
552,2.0,"I kept reading because I was hoping it would get better and redeem itself in the end, but it never did.  Rawness and grit do not substitute for depth.  I appreciated the accurate perspective of an elderly person.",Don't waste your time
152,5.0,This book is tagged as THE PROPHET by KAHLIL GIBRAN. Alas I know I'm easily annoyed but I didn't even open the sample of this book once I saw that the title and author were in all caps. I'm sure the text is fine but I didn't bother to look. I bought a different edition instead.,why all caps???
660,5.0,"My hatred for this book knows no bounds. This is the trashiest thing to infiltrate the literature section of the bookstore since Henry Miller. (Although I'm not a Henry Miller expert, I'm guessing he at least brought some literary merit to the table, which is more than I can say for this author!) The depression-era circus setting, although intriguing, was not enough to make up for the endless vulgarity, flat characterization and vapid dialogue. And, to make matters worse, no character, at least from the ones I can remember, is spared horrific scenes of physical abuse - you name it, woman, worker, elephant, dog, clown. I just got tired of it all after a while.Why did I even bother to finish it? It was sort of like watching Ripley's Believe it or Not to see what kind of ghastly thing would happen next. Well now I believe it; this is one of the worst contemporary books I've read.",It's Just Bad.
249,5.0,"I ordered this book through one of Amazon Marketplace sellers as it was no longer offered by Amazon itself. While the book is in the shape I ordered it (used-very good), I have not read it yet as I only just received it after ordering in it on 11/26/10. I received the book mid January, 2011.",Disappointed
741,5.0,"There might be a good story here, but personally, the excessive profanity and sexual situations were offputting.  I returned the book unfinished.",There might be a good story
318,5.0,"I bought this book when it first came out, because of the exceptional reviews I read.  I have never finished this book.  I started it, shelved it, read three books, went back to it and I just could not foster up enough interest to continue reading.  The story line is uninteresting and the characters were dull. I finally accepted that I would not likely ever to read it; so I tried to sell the book back to the store. The book store did not accept it because this item was not moving from the shelves!  It was definitely not worth the money I spent on this item.",Missing something
473,4.0,"The story was thoughtful and well-written.  The present-day Jacob was actually more compelling and believable than the Jacob of the main, remembered story.If you liked the circus world information, and have a high tolerance for some graphic content, read Gary Jennings' ""Spangle"" (which has been split into three separate books for paper back), a rich, detailed story of a circus in post-Civil War America and Europe.Spangle","Good, but if you like this one you will LOVE"
688,4.0,"For the most part this was a moving and fascinating story. Well written, the characters were vivid and appealing, even, at times, the villains. However, I found the way the story ended to be somewhat trite and not at all believable.Although the loyalty and brotherhood among circus people was clearly portrayed throughout, the end of the story reduced this excellent portrait of a mysterious and esoteric world into a fairy-tale. For me, the lovely flight ended with a thud, from a delicious learning experience to an insult to my intelligence.",Water for Elephants
58,5.0,"Kahlil Gibran - touchs the heart, the soul and the mind.Beautiful words that comfort and guide.If only more people would read his work, if you can call it work,Wonderful writing but the publisher (as many seem to do these days) get very artisticand print too faintly -  the letters are pale grey and very difficult to read.It isn't the writing it's the publisher at fault.The printers should realize that the entire purpose of the printed word isto let people READ it.",Gentle guidance and insights
533,3.0,"...but I just couldn't.  Honestly, it stressed me out.  I wasn't enchanted or transported, just full of anxiety at the turn of every page.  I read a lot of books, and I review very few, but this is a book I really wanted to love and had to force myself to finish.  I was hoping for something more along the lines of ""Carter Beats the Devil"", but instead I got ""The Devil tortures Carter and his girl and Carter ends up alone in a nursing home.""  I just couldn't get behind this story.","Oh, how I wanted to love this book..."
347,4.0,What a great storyline from beginning to end.  With such an amazing assortment of characters that feel like someone you know.  A great read.,Marlena
322,5.0,"With the making of a Film based on this book and all of the rave reviews about it, I guess I had high expectations.  Don't get me wrong, I found most of it entertaining, but I think the story lacked in its development, and I never figured out why religion was ever even brought up among the characters in the earlier part of the book, when it apparently had nothing to do with the plot. The ending was also a bit of a let-down because it was just too ""happily ever after"" for me.The funny thing is that I'm not a big fan of Circuses in general, but surprisingly, I found the source material to be rather fascinating,  So, if anything, this book will propel me to look into more historical reading material on Circuses from the 19th century to the turn of the 20th Century.",Expected more.
235,5.0,"Awkward cadence, lacks the usual old school Berenstain Bear charm (I despise the newer preachy books but expected this one to be up there with the great The Bear's Picnic.) The illustrations might be worth half a star but it's truly so dreadful I can't bring myself to go over a single star.",Not remotely their best
