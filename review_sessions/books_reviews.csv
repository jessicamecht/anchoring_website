718,5.0,"Everyone was talking about it last summer, and my book club decided to read it. I was very disappointed. Characters were not believable, there was too much cruelty to animals and violence here, nobody I really liked except the dwarf, and the back and forth from the young man to the nursing home got very dreary. I skipped a lot of pages because the early part was so boring.",Disappointment
731,5.0,I am one of the ones that really liked this book. I honestly chose this book because I knew the movie was coming out and wanted to read it first. I enjoyed the book better than the movie. There was much more detail. You could see the characters struggles and how they got there. I would recommend this book. It is a really fast read though.,Really Good.
448,4.0,"I expected more substance, but it's not there.  Still, reasonably well written and easily read--like (or with) a light pinot grigio.",Lightweight
802,5.0,"It was an interesting story, written well.  I have a new respect for elephants and the opposite for cruel handlers.",Good story
658,4.0,"I was given this book to borrow -- ""It is just a wonderful book."" I cannot stand mediocre writing, and for this reason I don't often read popular fiction. I pushed into it, however, hoping for the best. Just could never care at all about the characters. The old guy is grumpy and resentful. Some of the circus behind-the-scenes reporting is interesting, but much of that is pretty low-life and tawdry. Not for me. I will read the ending and report back to my friend, but I will not read the rest of it.","flat writing, not especially uplifting"
560,3.0,I did not like the language or the story. I have not finished the the book and have no interest in doing so,Not finished
643,4.0,I was really disappointed by this book. The only parts that were not too bad were the chapters where Jacob was an old man. But the circus stuff was very pedestrian. No spark to the writing. Don't waste your time.,pointless
304,5.0,its a great book and i enjoyed it as a little slow in some parts but other than that i really enjoyed it,good book
352,3.0,Chosen after reading an excerpt.  Good character descriptions. and scenes are beautifully depicted.  I felt involved in the story.  Bit of a surprise ending that leaves you wanting to stay with the main character a bit longer to see where he ends up.,Water for Elephants
378,3.0,"This book is not what I expected at all.....I guess I expected more of a love story as well as an adventure and what I got was neither. While I give the author credit for her obvious research on the era...the story was so incredibly slow!!! I kept thinking ""is this over yet??""  I wanted to like it I really did. Definitely a disappointment. I wish I thought differently.",not worth it......
309,5.0,This book was a quick read and a creative idea. But it was dry. It could and should have been elaborated on. It seemed as though the author was bored with writing it. Granted there were times of strong emotion but for the most part it was just lacking in all aspects.,"Overrated, dry"
607,5.0,"One of the best books I've ever read.  The writing was so beautiful and lyrical.  Great surprise ending.  I'm a voracious reader, but it's been a long time since I picked up a book and didn't set it back down until I turned the last page.  Loved the ""old guy"".",Couldn't put it down!
187,5.0,This is another wonderful book by Clarence Larkin. It was a gift for my husband since this is one of his favorite authors.He said it was an interesting  and informative book.,wonderful informative book
668,5.0,"Interesting book that makes you want to keep reading, but in the end, it seems like the author tried too hard to wrap things up and make everyone happy.I find that the best way to make reviews helpful is by adding a list of books I love and books I hated. That way you can compare and determine whether you and I have similar tastes. So here is my list:Books I love or at at least really, really like:We Need to Talk about Kevin.Tell the Wolves I'm HomeWhen the Emperor Was DivineThe History of HistoryThe Remains of the DayWe Have Always Lived in the CastleThe Night CircusWater for ElephantsThe Sisters BrothersThe Poisonwood BibleBooks I REALLY hated:The Bear in a Muddy Tutu1Q84The Buddha of SuburbiaA Visit from the Goon SquadSun StormA Long Way DownWhen We Were OrphansThe Haunting of Hill House","Interesting story and characters, but the ending is too &#34;Disney-like&#34;"
193,5.0,great book.  clarence larkin does a great job with this book in explaining revelations and makes it easy to understand,great book
244,5.0,"I wanted to like this book, but I expected a lot, and found it a disappointment.  The first half about Grania's struggles with learning how to communicate and trying to fit in with her family and friends was interesting and new perspective, even though a bit slow at times and not always that compelling.  As far as the second half, I have read other books that have dealt with the horrors of WWI, and this one offered not one new perspective or new point of view or descriptions.  I didn't see how it added to the story at all, and at this point in the book I really wished I wasn't reading it, but I guess some part of me wanted to find out what happened, and I felt that the ending was a let down.  Mostly, I feel that this topic could have been really, really engrossing, new, and compelling, but the book's lackluster plot and storytelling left me flat.  I won't recommend this book.",A disappointment
127,5.0,"You've got to be kidding, all you 5 star reviewers!  This overly sentimental trash is sickening! It just rambles on and on with nonsense. It is said that Gibran is a great poet. Really? It has no poetic value whatsoever. Save your $2, my friend, and if you're looking for enlightenment try &#34;Siddhartha&#34;.","Pompous, Pretentious, Platitudes"
568,5.0,"Good concept in terms of time, place and description of depression era circus life.  Writing is passable, but observations on human character are WEAK.  I regret reading this and should have just gone to the movie.","Great History and Concept, poor writing"
65,5.0,"I evidently misread the writeup, I thought it was a hardback.  It was a cheap paperback.  I got it as a present so I couldn't send it back but I'm very dissapointed for the cost!",Unexpected purchase
736,5.0,"Enjoyed the unique look at circus life in that time.  Also, the author had a very good understanding of, not only the process of aging, but how a person experiencing it thinks and feels!  The ending was surprising and pleasant, but not really realistic.",A look back as well as a lookl forward!
466,5.0,"Loved the book, the setting reminded me of the HBO series Carnivale. Read the book in one day because I could not put it down.",I was pulled into another world
69,5.0,"As Amin Rihani described his own friend Gibran, Gibran's style of writing is just &#34;mawkish sentimentalism&#34;. Yes, sentimentalism, and that is all Gibran is all about. For most Americans' taste, this guy is just pasty! And who can stomach that!","Pasty, pasty! Too much!"
90,5.0,"Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood for a heavily poetic book on one man's life philosophies, but this book lost me after the chapter on children. Some sections are insightful and very well written. On death, children, and love were my favorites. I'm not sure how novel these ideas were back in 1928 (?) when the book was first published, but they are nothing new today. Still, the flowery language is pretty, it's not overly long, and also it's probably one of those books that make you look cool when your reading it at a coffee shop.... so it's not all bad.This book was given to me by my dad who grew up in the 60's and 70's. It occurs to me that The Prophet seems to speak best to those from this generation (peace, love, and all that crap... you know). Maybe it's just not relevant to me? Maybe I need to approach it at a different time? Maybe I need to smoke something herbal?",Now I'm Sleepy
441,5.0,I dislike strange sexual behavior but most of all I hate killing and mistreatment of animals and other humans.  I just didn't look into the book far enough to realize these things were written about.,water for elephants not for me
768,5.0,"This book is well done.  Written in the style of a ""life review"", it is a look back on the life of a circus, and the characters that made it work.  I was suprised at how well I enjoyed it, and the development of the characters.  The reality of the life style that the carnies lived and  the social prejudcies involved.  This is a worth your time.",Love the circus
710,5.0,"I wasn't sure about this book when I chose it but it turned out to be a wonderful read!  I enjoyed reading about the circus secrets (both pleasant and ugly) and the drama in the love story was completely plausible, and the old Jacob was delightful.  As a person who lives 30 minutes away from the PT Barnum Museum in Bridgeport Connecticut and has visited it often, I just could picture all of this and I loved it.",I so enjoyed this book!
43,5.0,"Gibran Khalil Gibran was born in 1883 in what is now Northern Lebanon.  In 1909 he went to Paris to study, but he did not like the strict education, and so he traveled, eventually moving to New York.  Gibran became both an artist and a writer, and in 1923 he published ""The Prophet"", which is generally considered to be his greatest work.  He died of cancer in a New York hospital at the very young age of 48.The Prophet is a story about Almustafa (The Prophet) who after living 12 years in Orphalese is about to depart aboard ship to return to his home.  Before he goes, a group of people stop him, and to them he teaches the secrets of life.  Gibran writes in a very poetic manner, and it is wonderful to read.",The Lessons Of Life
480,5.0,"I looked at the reviews before purchasing this book - I thought I would love it. As it turned out, I had a hard time getting into the book. Once I finished it, I watched the movie to tie in the parts that I didn't get. It was not horrible, just not my taste.",Hard to follow at times
254,5.0,"Most of us don't know what to eat anymore with all the marketing out there, this book touches on a lot of subjects, I suppose it would be hard to go in-depth and keep the book under 500 pages.  I enjoyed it, you can read it bit by bit and look for certain information or you can go cover to cover.  An easy read.  It doesn't answer all my questions but at this point, I don't think anything will :)Also - fast shipping and a great price.",Covers A Lot of Subjects
202,4.0,"This is a wonderful looking book, I have not had a chance to start reading it, however the drawings alone are beyond great. The book arrived within three days of ordering, and the book is in great shape.",Can't wait to read it
443,5.0,"I am so tired of first person narratives, so maybe my complaint about his book isn't objective. All the ""I, I, I, I,"" really got on my nerves. The movie was so much better because I didn't have to read the word, ""I"" anymore. The book also contains a lot of offensive language, which didn't seem to fit the era. The story line was interesting and moved along at a nice pace.",I liked the movie better
361,3.0,"I loved this book.  And to think it was the first from Sara Gruen at that. This is a book that spawned the movie of the same name.  I saw the movie first, then read the book, then saw the movie again. As often happens, the book provides much more color than the movie ever could. For instance, the owner of the circus, Big Al, is shown in the movie in only one scene for a moment giving approval for a purchase.  Sara researched the subject of &#34;train circuses&#34; in detail.  The cruel practices common during the depression to stay in business are shocking, but make riveting reading as the backdrop for this story of growing up, awakening, and goal-seeking.  Highly recommended.",A great story of a lost era
192,5.0,"How people can make these types of mistakes is beyond me. There appears to have been no editor or proofreading before putting this up for sale and apparently no quailty control measures on Amazon's part. The problems:1. 4,500 locations or 450 pages are missing. This ebook is 500 locations or 50 pages.2. The reviews posted on the &#34;Kindle Store&#34; were clearly for the hard copy version3.  This &#34;book&#34; give a page or two &#34;outline&#34; of a topic. Example- there is no information detailing the seven churches like in the hard copy version just a 2 page turn &#34;outline&#34; saying the Book of Revelations speaks about seven churches.4. Complete information is just missing. The table of content looks consistent with the hard copy version yet once you spend $3.99 to buy it and click on a TOC link subtiles are not there.5. This ebook is just a very brief overview of what is in the Book of Revelations and what is in Larkin's actual book.I will be getting a refund from Amazon.","Dont buy for Kindle 4,500 locations missing (450 pages)!"
525,2.0,"I thought this book would be outstanding by all the really good reviews it got. But I only read about 3 1/2 chapters and called it quits. I just thought it was very dull reading. I thought perhaps, I would try again at some point to read it..but after thinking about that idea for a while--I decided that I wouldn't try reading it again. I will say I was disappointed; I will also say I would not suggest to anyone to read this book.  :(",I read the reviews..
644,5.0,It took me a long time to get into this book.  It is a little pornographic in parts.  But it ended up being good.  I loved the ending.  I can't wait until the movie comes out!,Pretty good is all I can say
392,5.0,The concept of this book was interesting to me but this book is boring. The characters are one dimensional and the main character is lame. I decided not to finish it after reading other reviews that say it is a waste of time (I got about half way through).,Boring Characters
170,3.0,"I know Beryl Bainbrige is a great writer but...this was my first Bainbridge novel and I didn't enjoy it very much. Am I not getting it? I have so many questions unanswered by this book. Why were Dr. Potter and Myrtle suffering through the Crimean war when they didn't have to be there? Was it Myrtle's utter devotion that kept her there? Why was Potter there? Were they camp followers? Also, did Myrtle bear Georgie and his wife's children for them because the wife couldn't? Or am I dreaming? There seems so much allusion in this book and I feel dumb for not getting what the other reviewers are getting from it. For me, it wasn't clear or easy to follow and I am not a stupid person. I'm a bit disappointed but will try another book of hers and hope that I will enjoy it more..",Too many unanswered questions
692,5.0,"I liked the way this novel was written, some in the present, and then in the past.  Satisfying ending.",Water for Elephants
677,5.0,"Life's a bitch and then you get old and it's worse and then you die.  That's all you need to know, which is a good thing because this novel has left me too depressed to write any more.",tedious
746,2.0,"Can a stint of a few months in a circus change a boy's life forever? Yawn. The novel is peopled with cut-outs: a diligent country boy orphaned the day before his final exams; an ethereally beautiful horse-tamer with a secret problem (a loutish husband); perverted dwarves; whores with golden hearts; etc. Retold from a retirement home, the novel seems prepped for cinematic treatment, and doesn't linger in literature. It hurtles towards a pre-ordained resolution: the match made in heaven, in the book, and a movie contract for the author. Boo.",Cheesy tearjerker with a feel-good ending
