0,3552,I love this book. I found this book on a boring summer night when i was 16. I could not put it down. I finished it in less than a week and lost it soon after that. I often thought about buying another copy  but couldnt even remember the title or the author. Im 25 now and just came across it by accident while searching on amazon. So happy. Great read. I highly recommend. Victoria holt is awesome.,perfect,5.0,0
1,2657,"Okay, first off, I had to think about this review long & hard before posting it.  Here goes...I feel cheated.  This book was so hyped up & I'm sure it had to do with the movie, which I refuse to see...but that's another story...I like the story.  I love the start & the end & for those that actually read the book...you know what I'm talking about.  For those that haven't read the book, I won't give it away.So what didn't I like?  SPOILER ALERT...stop here if you haven't read the book & plan to do so....I didn't like that the love story never really evolved.  It was just like Jake likes Marlena & she likes it...boom...now her husband knows they are in love.  WHAT?  When did that develop?  I needed more detail about their relationship & it just wasn't there.I did enjoy the history of the circus life & the life during the Depression.  I thought the Polish elephant was a riot.  I thought the old pictures from circus life back in this time period was a great addition to the book.But I really can't get over the story developement for Jake & Marlena.  Come on?  I can't be the only one who was expecting more on them??  Can I?Overall, the hype around this book was set too high.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.Guess I'll donate the book to the local library....","I'd actually like to rate it lower...too much hype, not enough detail...",1.0,0

3,1119,"""Water for Elephants"" was the last Book Club selection I read, and It was not my choice. Reading it was a bit of a chore for me because upon reading a small synposis of it, I felt like I was back in high school. But like I did in school, I learned something.  I learned about what it is like to be in a circus, to know what drives someone to join a circus, especially in a different generation.  The main protagonist, Jacob Jankowksi, however, was a likable character and I liked his spunk.  Each chapter is narrated by the Old and young Jacob.  The old version would be looking back in time, thus, the next chapter would bring us to that exact moment in time when he joined, and when he met the woman he would fall in love with.  The writing at times, really didn't give me any feeling that I could not put this book down.  There is something about Ms. Gruen's writing that I just can't put into words other than: I didn't care for it, and I don't think she's a very good writer.I am a very open minded reader and am willing to try anything.  This is one book that I feel I wasted far too much time on.

The circus train theme is interesting and fun to read, and this is what keeps the book going. One scene near the end depicted the main characters in a church; I thought this would be developed further. It turns out this was just added in to try to show the morality of Jacob, perhaps to foreshadow that he could never kill Marlena's husband August. Jacob started out at the beginning of the book as a naive innocent kid. How he could change into such an experienced risk-taker in a period of just a few months confused me.

15,3072,"I hate not finishing a book that I've started, but in the case of this incredibly long, drawn-out, and boring novel, I had no qualms whatsoever. The characters are as unsympathetic as they come, with the 2-D Maria who has probably never entertained a thought in her head, she is so stupid and empty, except to please Robert Jordan, who spends hundreds and hundreds of pages just thinking random thoughts, and walking from place to place. I thought that Anna Karenina was long and drawn out, but even at 800 + pages that book was less drawn out than this wprthless piece. It was completely unnecessary for it to be so long--one of Hemingway's short stories, about an old man on a bridge during the spanish civil war, at less than 3 pages is ten times more movign and poignant than this book. And it doesn't even really paint the Spanish civil war all that well--if you really want a glimpse of what it was like, go rent and watch the classic movie ""La lengua de los mariposas"" or ""Butterfly"" in English, which will give you a better idea and much mroe enjoyment at the same time. This book also isn't really that action-packed at all for a war book--I'd say fighting and battle takes up maybe two-fifths fo the book at the most, it's mostly just talking, long stories, long ten page thought streams of RJ, or just walking from place to place, describing things with some of the longest run-on sentences I've ever seen (anyone who tells you that Hemingway's style was just short and simple sentences is full of it in regard to this book).In short, this book is not worth your time--read one of Hemingway's short stories if you must, but not this long, drawn out, boring yarn.",Worst Book I've ever read,1.0,0

He lets August repeatedly beat the bejeesus out of Rosie, the elephant. But as soon as Marlena, August's tw*tty wife, appears with a black eye Jacob goes bonkers and attacks August. Okay... Really?! I'm not brushing off wife-beating here, but really?! One flipping black eye and August deserves to die? I would have killed that bastard for beating AND torturing Rosie LONG BEFOREHAND!! And then Jacob keeps harping about it: ""He hit her! He hit her! He hit her!"" Well, so what? It's not like she was tied to a stake like Rosie was. And the only reason she had the black eye was because August thought she was having an affair with Jacob! And then the author uses ""paranoid schizophrenia"" to explain August's behavior? Seriously?! He's just a possessive prick! With good reason to be ""paranoid,"" turns out, since Jacob really IS after his wife.The only main character that wasn't completely unlikable, really, was Walter aka Kinko but Jacob got him killed by being *gasp!* a stupid d**che.I'm not surprised this book is so popular, though.

He opposed 'bourgeois force', arguing that the latter has a purifying effect that enables people to take possession of themselves. The general strike moreover is of value as a 'social myth', an article of faith which inspires the workers in their struggle. For Sorel, social myths are important since they are 'not descriptions of things, but expression of a determination to act'. Although he later influenced Lenin, Mussolini and Action Franaise, he did not object to acknowledging himself an anarchist since 'Parliamentary Socialism professes a contempt for morality' and the new  ethic of the producers.""Mr Marshall, as a historian of anarchism, seems to share their indifference to facts.Sorel did not influence Lenin. Lenin called Sorel `the well-known advocate of confusion'. The Marxist historian of philosophy George Lukacs referred to Sorel's `totally insubstantial theory of myth'.

I got about halfway through before it became too boring. More recently, I tried reading it again from the beginning and got less than halfway through.The main problem with Red Mars is that the author finds it necessary to put in an excruciatingly large amount of detail in everything. From describing procedures the astronauts use to descriptions of the Martian environment. A certain amount of detail is nice and helps create a vivid image, but I am not an astronaut-in-training so all the excessive technical detail should have been avoided.In my own opinion, pretty much every character in the book is annoying. I found some of them rather flat. They seem intent on talking politics (read: the author's political beliefs) or getting themselves into love triangles and wondering what went wrong. This does not help when the story shifts from one character to another when it is hard to like any of them.The book teeters on the edge of complete implausibility. I can believe the technology used to get the First Hundred to Mars, but the fun ends there. First, we are led to believe that space agencies would be so mind-blowingly incompetent as to send a bunch of under-qualified astronauts on a long-term mission to Mars. Later in the book (and I do not think I am spoiling much here), the colonists come up with a plan to use a bunch of wind-powered heaters to increase the overall temperature of Mars.
