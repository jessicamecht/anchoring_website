0,3100,"in for whom the bell tolls hemingway looks at war from the individuals perspective. his army is a rag tag group of guerrilla fighters, not the army. the time and setting is the spanish civil war. a general understanding of that war is helpful. the characters include mostly local insurgents and one american mercenary. the horrors of war are portrayed on both sides with neither having the higher moral ground.it is also a study of courage in the face of potential death. this is developed not only through the underlying theme of war, but the stories of some of the characters earlier lives which include bull fighting and the running of the bulls.the one drawback to the book is the stilted language used in the dialog of the novel (including the refusal to use obscenities).a book well worth the read",profiles in courage,4.0,1
1,52416,"I'm a big fan of Lawhead's &quot;The Iron Lance&quot; and his &quot;Song of Albion&quot; series.  With high hopes, I purchased this historical novel.  My knowledge of St. Patrick is limited, and I looked forward to discovering more of his life and his spiritual influence in Ireland.&quot;Patrick: Son of Ireland&quot; does many things well.  The settings are believable and well-researched, the language fluid, and the dry details turned into fascinating tidbits.  I particularly enjoyed the Roman battle scenes and descriptions of the Plague.  Sobering stuff.  Succat, later known as Patrick, is a character with flaws and foibles, a man who grows slowly into the understanding of his calling.  And when Succat comes to a final point of humility and turning, Lawhead paints a succint and touching scene.  He employs Pelagius, who plays a minimal part in only the final thirty pages of the book, to address Succat: &quot;You have learned what a man can do in his own strength...Perhaps now it is time to learn what God can do with a man who knows the limits of his strength.&quot;Unfortunately, the book never allows us to see the result of this turning.  We witness years of futility in Succat's life, and, in fact, we ourselves grow weary of his attempts to escape slavery and of the deceits he thrusts upon even those he claims to love.  I appreciate that all this brings Succat to a medieval mid-life crisis, but I would've enjoyed seeing the working out of his newfound knowledge.  I even started to suspect that Lawhead would be throwing a sequel our way.  Instead, he throws us a bone--a prologue and epilogue that tidily skim over Patrick's years of hard spiritual work.I trod my way along the arduous trails of Succat's life, found some wisdom to be gained and some eventual rewards, but felt cheated by the blithe conclusion.  Am I missing a sequel, or is this all we get?",3 1/2 Stars...Am I Missing a Sequel?,3.0,1
2,10500,"I know Mr. Sheldon has written a gazillion books, and I am certain that I once read one by him that I really liked, but I cannot remember which one, and it is MOST DEFINITELY not this one. This book is boring, slow-paced, and dull. Dana Evans, for one, starts out as a least likely mom type, which is how she is dropped into the plot, and true to form, turns out to be an awful Mom. Right away I didn't like her because of this and couldn't feel for her. She runs around the globe leaving her &quot;son&quot; with a lady she just met, but she does call once in awhile. Dana Evans' next sin is to tolerate the unheard of relationship between her fiance, Jeff, and his ex-wife, who just happens to be a perfect ten in every way. Dana questions in her mind, to her credit, but she sure is a whole lot more patient than any American woman I know. As Dana chases a murder story that winds up getting top government officials to tell her things that they have never told anyone (and this while she is a Star Reporter!), her son is first a troublemaker and then neglected at home. Nonetheless, our heroine plunges forth, reveals all, and there is a nice, homey, happy ending that - well, that left me nauseated. Don't waste your time on this one, I imagine Sidney Sheldon fans are pretty disappointed, because I would hate to think this is a sample of his work.",Lousy.,1.0,0

4,9003,"This was all plots and plans and no action. While it might have pictured what life was actually like in the Boleyn/Howard family, there was no action to it -- and I know that ""plots and plans"" can actually make a decent book, because ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" proves it!Thankfully, I didn't buy this book alone (I bought it at the same time I bought ""The Queen's Fool""), or I would've discounted Ms. Gregory as a truly boring author altogether. Hopefully, this book was just a fluke and her others (like ""The Constant Princess"" and ""The Virgin's Lover"") are just as good as ""The Queen's Fool"".",Bored Out of My Gourd,1.0,1

If Chabon had submitted any part of this book as a freshman English paper, he would have received an ""F"" for his diction.  The story was interesting and I did finish it, but the language was forced and jerky in its tempo.  It is a strange time to be a Jew ...or not...",A strange time indeed...,1.0,1

8,14374,"What an embarrassing disaster for this author and publisher. Had they bothered to have the book read by anyone who knows anything about German history, they would have gotten some helpful comments. Gaines reduces the very real statebuilding accomplishments of the Hohenzollern family to a mixture of scurrilous gossip and prurient commentary. There are numerous mistakes in the part of the book that have to do with Protestant history (e.g., neither Ulrich Zwingli nor Thomas Muentzer were Anabaptists), when the author is not merely repeating nostalgic hearsay about its various events. He is totally ignorant of the social context of a number of the compositions he discusses (e.g., saying it that was daring of Bach to compose a piece with the title ""God is my kind"" for a civic occasion--actually, such pieces were customary and commissioned in order to heighten the civic consciousness of the burghers who sponsored them). After 150 pp. of nonsense and error, I was no longer sympathetic to his larger argument. Too bad the publisher didn't find a better manuscript on early modern German cultural history, since it is a fascinating topic. Unfortunately reading this book conveys no sense of its fascination. I'd give it zero if that were an option.",A mixture of error and scurrilous gossip,1.0,1
9,31049,"***NOTE: MILD SPOILERS***I was excited to finally sit down and read this book after enjoying the first int he series when it came out a while back. I expected a fun adventure continuing the feeling of the first book, and I was seriously disappointed.First off, the beginning is very jarring. The book continues right off of where the first one ended, and it can be very difficult for a reader to remember all the little details and connections with characters that I last saw nearly a year ago. That aside however...Throughout the entire book the characters were incredibly erratic bordering on bipolar. With little to no motivation they would be either paralyzed with fear one minute and the next throwing chairs off of rooftops or just walking 10+ miles to the HQ of the bad guys because one person died (after hundreds/thousands were killed in cold blood, NOPE must stop these few people from dieing.)The most glaring example of this comes from the &#34;evil&#34; leader herself. After enslaving an entire faction to her mind control, killing countless more, and threatening to kill everyone left just to get ahold of a strong Divergent, she tries TWICE, then suddenly gives up and attempts to execute Tris instead of continuing with her research. This makes NO sense at all.This was nothing and nowhere near what Divergence had the potential to be. This is mindless fluff from an author who is unsure of where the series is going to go, and is reluctant to force the characters into any one situation or motivation. This is just chaos start to finish.Hopefully others learn from this author's mistakes. I won't be reading the next novel in this series.",Incredibly disappointing.,1.0,0
