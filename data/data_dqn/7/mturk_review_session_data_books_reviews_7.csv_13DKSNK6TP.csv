0,979,"""Water for Elephants"" by Sara Gruen,  2006Ms. Gruen writes an odd story.  It is really two stories in one.  The main one is of an almost veterinarian, Jacob Jankowski, who becomes caught up in the life of a circus.  It is a romance: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back (whoopee).  In the afterword the author explains that she was wanting to do a story about the photographer of circus', but she got caught up in all the rest of the circus history and it became this book.  It is worthy and good.  The second is of the same man in a nursing home, or some such place, who sort of does not belong there.  He has lived his life and remembers it well.  The instigation is the circus has come to town!!The chapters are defined by when is the story being told.  Sometimes it is now: he is old and ornery; the next one, he is remembering his life in the circus.  The value is in the perspective: as an old man, he has problems, but he deals with them, somewhat; as a young man he grows up and finds the love of his life.  It is always wonderful to read a story of love growing and becoming the be all to end all.  But real love is of the animals, horses, elephants, orangutans, chimpanzees and doing something constructive.  In the end you feel that everything is wonderful and has come out all right.The odd thing, like in some other places I have seen (""Passenger 54""), the title comes from out of the blue, once, and it is never explained or spoken of again.",the life of a circus,5.0,1

The characters are flimsy, the plot is circuitous and the endless stories of animal cruelty are downright depressing.

8,2800,"Presented through a series of flashbacks by a cantankerous nursing home patient, the story begins as Jacob Jankowski is confronted with the death of his parents.  Hastily, he drops out of school and flees to the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.  After a fair amount of drama, Jacob is offered a position as vet with the traveling circus.  What follows is, well... a circus - especially when Rosie shuffles into town...Honestly, we could go either way on this novel.  For some reason we are drawn to the enchantment of the circus, so the setting was interesting enough to keep our attention.  We thought the novel captured the spirit of the traveling circus and pulled the curtain on some of the more sleazy aspects of the business.  The treatment of the animals was at times appalling as was the practice of chucking circus workers from moving trains.In many ways, the characters were almost as entertaining as the circus.  Jacob was complex and real.  The lovely Marlena was just as intriguing and provocative in real life as she was in her animal act.  The head animal trainer was pretty much a complete jerk-bag throughout.  Rosie the Elephant was incredibly enduring and a formidable animal character.  And the bearded lady... yeesh.So why didn't we love this book? We're not sure.  It just felt like something was missing.  Maybe there was too much bitterness and anger in the narrator or maybe the relationship between Jacob and Marlena could have been developed more or maybe a high flying monkey act should have been incorporated into the performance.  Whatever the case Water for Elephants was a good book, but not great, and definitely not in our top 10 for 2011.

18,2962,"""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" tells the story of young American Spanish teacher who goes to volunteer in the Spanish civil war. The entire novel takes place over 72 hours in which Robert Jordon, the young American, is responsible, as part of a bigger attack, to bomb a bridge and by that ensure that the Fascists won't be able to send reinforcements after the attack has begun. During those intense 72 hours, Robert Jordon falls in love with Maria, a Spanish girl whose family was murdered by the Fascists. (Isn't it amazing how Hemingway's characters always manage to fall in love faster than it takes one to finish smoking a cigarette?) The story follows Robert Jordon's preparations for the attack and his relationship with Maria and the guerrilla fighters who will assist him with the attack.I am fairly puzzled by this novel, which is considered by many to be Hemingway's best. It offers brilliant observations into the mind of his solider and the psychological aspects of participating in war and how Jordon copes with the hardships of it. While reading some parts of this novel, I was fully absorbed and captivated. In others, I felt it was rather long-winded. Perhaps some editing would have been handy. Although I don't think it is Hemingway's best, I do recommend it to Hemingway's fans.",Not my favorite Hemingway,3.0,0

Sorry, but I didn't find the ending memorable at all. Then there's this hard-to-visualize part where they have an LONG elevator or something attached to one of Mars' moons.

27,760,"Water for Elephants is an interesting text because it is not especially well written, the story is pure soap opera, and yet it is an enjoyable read that at times evokes a long gone era. I think it suffers from overly effusive praise and so many readers are bitterly disappointed once they get through it.First, let's look at the strengths of the novel. I enjoyed the evocations of circus and train life. Gruen clearly spent some time working on these descriptions of circus life and there are little Depression era details that were nice historical jewels for the reader to mine. Also effective was her characterization of old Jacob. His voice was witty and biting and he provided the most pleasure of any character in the text. Chapter nineteen of the novel is the saddest depiction of rest home life I have read in literature. A man is forgotten by his family, and the scene is heartbreaking.Now to examine the reasons why this book is unsatisfying. First off the characters from the 1930s parts of the novel are some of the weakest characterizations I have seen in a book in a long time. They are stock characters at best, and the villains are the mustache twirling men from melodrama. It is hard to care about any of the characters because they are so transparently fake. Even more distracting then the weak characterization is the incredibly insipid (and modern sounding) dialogue Gruen puts in their mouths. She has such nice historical details in the setting of the text, why couldn't she also use it in the dialogue?Many readers have found the ending unsatisfying, and although it is ridiculous, it fits the novel so I won't argue with it. The cloying depiction of animals is also a little beyond the pale, but again, I simply had to come to terms with the novel for what it is. It is popular fiction. It is a melodrama you will get caught up in. And for those purposes it is adequate. Don't go into it expecting more than what it is capable of giving and you will be satisfied.",Melodrama (3.5 stars),3.0,0
28,3072,"I hate not finishing a book that I've started, but in the case of this incredibly long, drawn-out, and boring novel, I had no qualms whatsoever. The characters are as unsympathetic as they come, with the 2-D Maria who has probably never entertained a thought in her head, she is so stupid and empty, except to please Robert Jordan, who spends hundreds and hundreds of pages just thinking random thoughts, and walking from place to place. I thought that Anna Karenina was long and drawn out, but even at 800 + pages that book was less drawn out than this wprthless piece. It was completely unnecessary for it to be so long--one of Hemingway's short stories, about an old man on a bridge during the spanish civil war, at less than 3 pages is ten times more movign and poignant than this book. And it doesn't even really paint the Spanish civil war all that well--if you really want a glimpse of what it was like, go rent and watch the classic movie ""La lengua de los mariposas"" or ""Butterfly"" in English, which will give you a better idea and much mroe enjoyment at the same time. This book also isn't really that action-packed at all for a war book--I'd say fighting and battle takes up maybe two-fifths fo the book at the most, it's mostly just talking, long stories, long ten page thought streams of RJ, or just walking from place to place, describing things with some of the longest run-on sentences I've ever seen (anyone who tells you that Hemingway's style was just short and simple sentences is full of it in regard to this book).In short, this book is not worth your time--read one of Hemingway's short stories if you must, but not this long, drawn out, boring yarn.",Worst Book I've ever read,1.0,0

The story was good, although I found the flashing back and forth distracting, and Sara Gruen obviously did copious amounts of research, but I just couldn't get excited about it.The character of Marlena could have been a really interesting and multi-layered person, but instead she is really only presented as a delicate flower who loves animals, married a psychopath, and sometimes displays teenage acts of defiance. Why did Jacob love her so much? There must have been more to her than that, but the reader is never let in on that secret. It's even more odd because the author is a woman. They had strong female personalities in the 1930s, I'm sure of it.As for Jacob, I thought that he displayed a lot of the conflict and inner questioning that you like to see in a lead character and his development as he gets to know the people that work for the circus was enjoyable. His relationship with the animals was obviously meant to heal him after the death of his parents, but again, I felt like that connection was rushed and then brushed aside. His relationship with Rosie, the gentle and abused Polish speaking (well, Polish understanding) elephant, was an excellent metaphor for his own gentle nature and his inability to stand up for himself and break free. Of course, in the end, everyone is free thanks to Rosie and we get the happy ending.I did not hate the book at all, but I wanted more from it. I think if the author had been allowed to write about 100 pages more, it could have been a great novel instead of just ok.

I got about halfway through before it became too boring. More recently, I tried reading it again from the beginning and got less than halfway through.The main problem with Red Mars is that the author finds it necessary to put in an excruciatingly large amount of detail in everything. From describing procedures the astronauts use to descriptions of the Martian environment. A certain amount of detail is nice and helps create a vivid image, but I am not an astronaut-in-training so all the excessive technical detail should have been avoided.In my own opinion, pretty much every character in the book is annoying. I found some of them rather flat. They seem intent on talking politics (read: the author's political beliefs) or getting themselves into love triangles and wondering what went wrong. This does not help when the story shifts from one character to another when it is hard to like any of them.The book teeters on the edge of complete implausibility. I can believe the technology used to get the First Hundred to Mars, but the fun ends there. First, we are led to believe that space agencies would be so mind-blowingly incompetent as to send a bunch of under-qualified astronauts on a long-term mission to Mars. Later in the book (and I do not think I am spoiling much here), the colonists come up with a plan to use a bunch of wind-powered heaters to increase the overall temperature of Mars.
