Even during a stop at a stop light coming home from work, I would get in a few pages. I definitely plan on reading his other book in the very near future! Highly recommended to all my friends and family. Don't waste your time with cookie-cutter authors whose books are always at Walmart and Target, buy Craig's book today, you will not be disappointed!",Stop everything and read this book!,5.0,1

I haven't cried Thu  much since reading Mocking Jay or the last few books of Harry Potter. it's  not easy to make me cry but Veronica Roth has done it. Fantastic book!",Amazing,5.0,1
2,36093,"Dear V. Roth (an open letter)It is you.  Like an ex that one is afraid to admit having ever loved, I propose the following:1- you take a writing class (really) I read the Legend series and the Maze Runner series also and know when an author has ...2- We agree never to see each other again.  You can keep my money, but be aware that it is the last bit of money you will ever see from me again...3- I will agree to see better writers4- I will NOT recommend this series to my YA readers (it was that bad)Signed, Scrapper","It is not me, it is you",1.0,0
3,12993,"This book is on the shelf withRadical Son: A Generational Odysseyand""I Heard You Paint Houses"": Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran and the Inside Story of the Mafia, the Teamsters, and the Last Ride of Jimmy Hoffa. This is a great memoir that illuminates both the man and his times. Regarding the man, if one would read Frasers,Quartered Safe Out Here: A Recollection of the War in Burma, IMHO one of the great war memoirs,and see the suffering, the privation, death and destruction related there; well, it might give some insight to the personality, the nature of the man many reviewers here find off putting and embarrassing. I guess when you run across an open field to take a Japanese position and you see friends fall dead around you, it may affect you. How then to deal with that? One way I feel is to come to believe (if you didn't earlier), that this suffering and loss must be for something big! Something worth fighting for.Perhaps England?As regards the times, as the years pass and one watches the country and way of life you fought for and your friends died for, spin down the drain like so much dirty water, well maybe if you had a set of balls you'ld be irate. Fraser sure was and from the outside looking in it appears he had good reason. The book is divided into three main themes, Angry Old Man (my favorite), guess what that's about? Interlude (second favorite), it's a kind of AOM lite, and Shooting Scripts, about his Hollywood days. This is a great memoir by an Angry Old Man. Deal with it!And if anyone from ESPN/Santana Sports sees this, how 'bout covering the SignPost race?",Man Lit For......errrr....Men,5.0,1

5,35405,"I was on board for the entire series. I didn't care for the small chapters jumping back and forth, it made a disconnect between the characters for me. The sudden, and I mean sudden, demise of a strong female character ( don't want to say any names) doesn't make her any stronger by her self sacrifice. I happened just about the time you figured out what was going on.Usually I'll reread a book several times, as I have all of the other books in the series. Not this one. I was shocked, disappointed and unsatisfied with the entire book and think it could have gone in a much different direction and could even have been a follow up story. A huge reader who is faithful to characters. Hate seeing Four left out in the cold all over again.Ironically, this is the very first negative review I have ever written.",unhappy,1.0,0
6,8477,"I have read many of Lisa's books, and have enjoyed them.  But, this one comes across as so contrived --- too many things just fall into place -- and everything is wrapped up much too quickly at the end.  It seems impossible to me that there would be enough organ donors in the city of Philadelphia to sway an election.  Marta is beaten up within an inch of her life, and still jumps in the car and drives to the Jersey Shore --------- very implausible.  And, the ending seems thrown together in an attempt to sweep up all the debris.",Too contrived,2.0,0
7,27722,"I was very interested to read Zuckoff's ""Lost in Shangri-La.""  I'm a sucker for non-fiction accounts about people doing things or surviving experiences that are foreign to me.  For this reason, I picked up this book with a great deal of excitement.  I was sorely disappointed.I was looking forward to reading about how a group of plane crash survivors braved through a foreign jungle, fighting animals and cannibals, to eventually make their way back to civilization.  The reviews and book jacket made it read like a thrilling adventure in the heart of the jungle, with lots of action and suspense.  What I got was something much different.Spoiler alert!  Do not read on if you don't want some of the book spoiled for you!The survivors don't have to trek that far before they make it to a clearing. They basically stay there until they are rescued.  The natives are not restless, nor all that cannibalistic.  Basically, they are simple, kind people who take an interest in helping the survivors.  They are eventually rescued by a daring glider-related escape.  This was one of the only truly entertaining parts of the book for me.TThere was also too much background information on people that didn't need to be told.  We didn't need to know all the background info (birthplace, former jobs, marital status, etc.) on the press corps that covered the story, or other characters that weren't survivors.  I ended up skipping through much of it to get to the end.If you are really into true-life adventure stories, I highly recommend that you check out Jon Krakauer's booksInto Thin Air (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)andInto the Wild.  They are gripping, tightly told, and exhilarating reads.  Another interesting read isThe Lost City of Z: A Tale of Deadly Obsession in the Amazon, about a man who journeys into the Amazon.  I recommend these much more than Zuckoff's book.","Not enough of a gripping, compelling story",2.0,0

9,17647,"Frank McCourt is a wonderfull story teller.I can almost hear that Irish accent as i read this book!  Very touching,funny,sad,many emotions felt while reading this book.Yes,Frank had a depressing childhood but he shares  it with us in a very colourful way.There's no doubt that the poverty he  lived in was appaling but this book is not just a story where another Irish  child grows up in a slum and goes nowhere.He shares his dreams,his  thoughts,his longing to be someone and go somewhere.  He tells this story  in such a delightful way that you can't help reading on.For those of you  who cannot hear an Irish speaking voice in your head I recommend you listen  to this on the cassette that is available.This book is very moving and very  well written.If you liked this book then please read the follow on called  'Tis.",Very touching,4.0,1
