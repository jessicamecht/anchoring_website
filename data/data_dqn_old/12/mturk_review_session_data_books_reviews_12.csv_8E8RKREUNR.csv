Along with social instabilities and sociopathic gangsters we Cuban tobacco farms, war ships. Ridiculous plot. Author should stick to writing about Patrick.",the most ridiculous Forrest Gump saga I've read.,1.0,0
3,58305,"How can anyone NOT give this book 5 stars?  I appreciated the foreword, preface, afterword, explanatory notes &amp; the notes about the author by Matthew J. Bruccoli which enlightened my eyes before I started on the path of reading The Great Gatsby.It's funny that somehow my high school English teacher skipped this as required reading for me in the mid to late seventies.  I bought the book for my niece, Ashley, a few years ago.  I remembered a co-worker, Kim, who was an avid reader who once told me that The Great Gatsby was her all-time favorite book.  I was curious.  It's strang that it took my 17 year old niece to 'get me on the bandwagon' to finally read this classic book at age forty-one.  It amazes me to realize that the author, F. Scott Fitzgerald, died at age forty-four in Southern California on December 21, 1940, believing himself a failure.It's quite clear that Fitzgerald's ideas may have been 'made up' but he sued real life people, his own experiences and other true events to make his story.In retrosprect, the novel contains a story of money, greed, love, deceit, suspense, hate, alcoholism, stress, passion, time, ambition, death, life, status, 'leaving a mark in life', pleasure, vacation, free time, heroes, lies, trust, women vs. men, the 1920s, mystery, intrigue, romance, poor vs. rich, Sundays in the park, art, happiness, choices, fashion, lust, loneliness, friendship, adventure, honesty, making conversation, scenic views, people, music, dance, avoidance, communication, observation, summer, intelligence, panic, forgetting, agin, laughter, family values, prejudice, jealousy, past, future, youth, tranquility, grief, responsibility, self-improvement, self-actualization, carelessness, escaping and living life.",The 'Has It All' American Classic Novel,5.0,1

So dependent on money for her happiness.I really disliked her and Tom by the end of the book.  I really liked the story though.  F. Scott Fitzgerald was a great writer.",Feel differently reading this as an adult,4.0,1
6,6946,"This book does have some worthy insights, however the author tends to pigeonhole people into oversimplified categories according to the ""games"" they play to get their needs met.  In real life however, I think people are more likely to fall into various roles, or games, at different times in their lives. Something about the presentation seemed just a little pretentious, too. The author sometimes appeared to think he was giving away some secret bits of information, heretofore known only by him or a few select others.  This left a bad taste in my mouth.  Nonetheless, some of the information presented was very valid, and at the very least the book serves as an excellent reminder that we are all afraid of rejection, no matter who we are.  But we are not all ""losers"", in spite of the games we play; I don't think the author gives enough emphasis to this fact.  In addition, I think that sometimes life is just what it is, and looking at it like it is some kind of game is of no useful value whatsoever.  Watch out if you think you are having some kind of ""aha!"" experience, as it will be short-lived.",Worth giving a look,3.0,0
7,48789,"I hated this book.  I can't think of a nicer way to put it.  The author completely changes the plot of JANE EYRE, and to change the plot of the original is a total no-no.  I am surprised that anyone published this monstrosity.  If I could give zero stars, I would.  None of the characters remain true to the way Bronte depicted them, and I believe she would be sickened by what Emma Tennant did to her novel.  I only finished it to see how much worse it would get, and believe me, it got a lot worse before it was over.",Absolutely Hideous,1.0,0
8,33133,"In this round, Four transforms into a fourteen year old girl with a princess poster on his wall, Tris continues to have every awesome trait pounded away from her person, and hundreds of pages are dedicated to the same brain numbing sermon, bad science, and destruction of the word genetics. We get it. She's totally into sacrifice, and if someone isn't loudly martyred at the end, the book will only be 30% waterlogged with Christian propaganda.I saw the end of Season Five of Buffy. That was a pretty good hero-death sacrifice that broke my heart and blew my mind. I read the Game of the Thrones series. That was a great one with multiple first person narrators and incredible human sacrifice, building towards some ultimate greater good. Both of these series still have my heart. People are not angry because of the events of the ending; they are angry because the ending was pointless, the book is poorly written, and much of the big reveals are utter nonsense. This was just a mess from a writer perhaps pushed too hard by her publisher to finish something quickly, and as a result took every easy exit away from her loyal fans.",George RR Martin makes a better George RR Martin,1.0,0
9,10500,"I know Mr. Sheldon has written a gazillion books, and I am certain that I once read one by him that I really liked, but I cannot remember which one, and it is MOST DEFINITELY not this one. This book is boring, slow-paced, and dull. Dana Evans, for one, starts out as a least likely mom type, which is how she is dropped into the plot, and true to form, turns out to be an awful Mom. Right away I didn't like her because of this and couldn't feel for her. She runs around the globe leaving her &quot;son&quot; with a lady she just met, but she does call once in awhile. Dana Evans' next sin is to tolerate the unheard of relationship between her fiance, Jeff, and his ex-wife, who just happens to be a perfect ten in every way. Dana questions in her mind, to her credit, but she sure is a whole lot more patient than any American woman I know. As Dana chases a murder story that winds up getting top government officials to tell her things that they have never told anyone (and this while she is a Star Reporter!), her son is first a troublemaker and then neglected at home. Nonetheless, our heroine plunges forth, reveals all, and there is a nice, homey, happy ending that - well, that left me nauseated. Don't waste your time on this one, I imagine Sidney Sheldon fans are pretty disappointed, because I would hate to think this is a sample of his work.",Lousy.,1.0,0
