0,3100,"in for whom the bell tolls hemingway looks at war from the individuals perspective. his army is a rag tag group of guerrilla fighters, not the army. the time and setting is the spanish civil war. a general understanding of that war is helpful. the characters include mostly local insurgents and one american mercenary. the horrors of war are portrayed on both sides with neither having the higher moral ground.it is also a study of courage in the face of potential death. this is developed not only through the underlying theme of war, but the stories of some of the characters earlier lives which include bull fighting and the running of the bulls.the one drawback to the book is the stilted language used in the dialog of the novel (including the refusal to use obscenities).a book well worth the read",profiles in courage,4.0,1
1,37080,"A Game Of thrones was a fantastic book. While I didn't like A Clash Of Kings, it was still an okay book. A Storm Of Swords is one of the best fantasy books ever written. So what happened? GRRM is a good writer. He may make mistakes, and he may over describe things at times, but he's a good writer nonetheless. ................ So why does this book (And the fifth book) SUCK? I don't know. But It's awful. I don't really know what I can say that hasn't been said, so I'm just going to finish the review now.",The downfall of the series,1.0,1

5,14170,"I have long been a fan of Michael Chabon's work.  ""Kavalier and Klay"" is one of my favorite contemporary novels.  I also loved the idea for ""Yiddish Policeman's Union"", a temporary Jewish homeland in Alaska.  Sadly, after I finished the last page I was very disappointed and wondered if he struggled mightily and rushed the novel out to print.  I think it's a third draft of a novel that he needed another draft or two to make it work.The best thing about the book is the way he fleshes out Sitka with the politics, economics, language and culture.  I was able to believe this place could exist.  The worst thing about the book is his main character, Landsman who I didn't find compelling, believable, or likeable.  Add to that is the problem of an inconsistent voice and occasionally confusing point of view.  One of the keys to detective fiction is voice and point of view.  If those aren't strong, then no matter how well you describe the backdrop to the story, it  loses credibility because reader doesn't commit to the character who acts as a guide to that world.The only character that came across as palpably real was the murdered victim who re-emerges later in an awkward flash back.  In only a few paragraphs, he comes across as a character I could follow through this book and who could bring it to life.Despite my disappointment, I'm glad that Chabon risks failure, stretches beyond his talent because that will only make him a better writer.  He hasn't written his masterpiece.  I'm sure that's yet to come.",A Courageous Misfire,2.0,0
6,34297,"I was really looking forward to this book, I pre-ordered it all the way back in May, but it was really not on par with the other two.  Like other reviewers have said, the dual POV was poorly done.  I couldn't tell which character was speaking and about halfway through I decided I didn't care anymore.  The revelation about what the divergent actually are was kind of a let down.  The factions being a form of behavior modification was not explained well and didn't make sense to me.  It was a weak explanation of how the world of factions that existed in the first two books could come to be.  And most of all I don't think killing Tris was necessary or a good idea.  I think the situation in reverse would have been better.  The plan being for Tris to go in and set off the memory serum becuase she had a chance of survival and then at the last minute Caleb stepping in and sacrificing himself.  We already knew Tris would sacrifice herself for others, she did it several times in the previous books.  It also might have shown that the GDs weren't so damaged after all.The book was bad enough and the ending shocking enough that I actually wondered if the author did it on purpose.  A lot of people are saying that they won't go watch the movie now, and I'm wondering if that was the point.",Bad...just bad,1.0,0

8,27722,"I was very interested to read Zuckoff's ""Lost in Shangri-La.""  I'm a sucker for non-fiction accounts about people doing things or surviving experiences that are foreign to me.  For this reason, I picked up this book with a great deal of excitement.  I was sorely disappointed.I was looking forward to reading about how a group of plane crash survivors braved through a foreign jungle, fighting animals and cannibals, to eventually make their way back to civilization.  The reviews and book jacket made it read like a thrilling adventure in the heart of the jungle, with lots of action and suspense.  What I got was something much different.Spoiler alert!  Do not read on if you don't want some of the book spoiled for you!The survivors don't have to trek that far before they make it to a clearing. They basically stay there until they are rescued.  The natives are not restless, nor all that cannibalistic.  Basically, they are simple, kind people who take an interest in helping the survivors.  They are eventually rescued by a daring glider-related escape.  This was one of the only truly entertaining parts of the book for me.TThere was also too much background information on people that didn't need to be told.  We didn't need to know all the background info (birthplace, former jobs, marital status, etc.) on the press corps that covered the story, or other characters that weren't survivors.  I ended up skipping through much of it to get to the end.If you are really into true-life adventure stories, I highly recommend that you check out Jon Krakauer's booksInto Thin Air (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)andInto the Wild.  They are gripping, tightly told, and exhilarating reads.  Another interesting read isThe Lost City of Z: A Tale of Deadly Obsession in the Amazon, about a man who journeys into the Amazon.  I recommend these much more than Zuckoff's book.","Not enough of a gripping, compelling story",2.0,0
9,31049,"***NOTE: MILD SPOILERS***I was excited to finally sit down and read this book after enjoying the first int he series when it came out a while back. I expected a fun adventure continuing the feeling of the first book, and I was seriously disappointed.First off, the beginning is very jarring. The book continues right off of where the first one ended, and it can be very difficult for a reader to remember all the little details and connections with characters that I last saw nearly a year ago. That aside however...Throughout the entire book the characters were incredibly erratic bordering on bipolar. With little to no motivation they would be either paralyzed with fear one minute and the next throwing chairs off of rooftops or just walking 10+ miles to the HQ of the bad guys because one person died (after hundreds/thousands were killed in cold blood, NOPE must stop these few people from dieing.)The most glaring example of this comes from the &#34;evil&#34; leader herself. After enslaving an entire faction to her mind control, killing countless more, and threatening to kill everyone left just to get ahold of a strong Divergent, she tries TWICE, then suddenly gives up and attempts to execute Tris instead of continuing with her research. This makes NO sense at all.This was nothing and nowhere near what Divergence had the potential to be. This is mindless fluff from an author who is unsure of where the series is going to go, and is reluctant to force the characters into any one situation or motivation. This is just chaos start to finish.Hopefully others learn from this author's mistakes. I won't be reading the next novel in this series.",Incredibly disappointing.,1.0,1
