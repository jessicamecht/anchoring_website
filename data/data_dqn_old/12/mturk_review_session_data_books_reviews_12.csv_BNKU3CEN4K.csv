1,53948,"""Mr. Paradise"" has its moments, like when the Top Ten Dumb Criminals list comes up, or when Kelly, the beautiful model, sees through Frank the homicide detective immediately, or when Frank tries to concentrate on the crimes he's investigating rather than on Kelly's beautiful body.And then, of course, is the whole idea of the ""almost"" twins play-acting as topless cheerleaders for Mr. Paradise. Or the flip of the coin by Paradise to see who gets which one. (Some TV show loves to depict women jumping on trampolines. Same appeal.)Leonard aficionados will expect the worst, and they'd be right. One chopped up body, cut in six parts by a chain saw. One bungled stock transaction. Three criminals, three shots at a ""business"" meeting. Enough blood and bungling for even the choosiest of Leonard critics.

2,12580,"In my line of work, I have to drive a lot from school to school with trips taking anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour and a half. These Nine Hours of adventure, hobbits, men, dwarves, elves and Tom Bombadil, (yes, Tom Bombadil!) is a great way to pass the time. Unlike the Unabridged Reading where the casual listener can get bogged down in the misings of the reader (a production which should be given justice in a situation where you can give it your full attention), this exciting performance with a great cast of voices and well done music is just what the traveling listener needs. Gandalf, Sam, Frodo and Aragorn's voices have to be my favorites. Gollum and Gimli are a bit overdone but to interesting effect but they are all leagues better than the BBC version. I bought that first figuring that a British version would be the golden standard but Gollum just sounded like a normal guy who occasionally slurped or sucked his words and Gandalf sounded like a real loser. The Gandalf here speaks with authority as does Aragorn. Sam has just the right touch of innocence and Frodo never lets the listener down. All the major events of the books with the exception of Galadriel being tempted by the Ring are very well presented. What a sight for sore eyes (or ears I should say) was it to hear Tom Bombadil's merry voice, a favorite of fans and readers who never quite made it into any production at all of the series. The battles are all satisfying as is the climax in Mount Doom and the skirmish with Shelob. I recommend it for journeys long and short.",The Best Audio Production I've Yet Heard,5.0,1

4,10500,"I know Mr. Sheldon has written a gazillion books, and I am certain that I once read one by him that I really liked, but I cannot remember which one, and it is MOST DEFINITELY not this one. This book is boring, slow-paced, and dull. Dana Evans, for one, starts out as a least likely mom type, which is how she is dropped into the plot, and true to form, turns out to be an awful Mom. Right away I didn't like her because of this and couldn't feel for her. She runs around the globe leaving her &quot;son&quot; with a lady she just met, but she does call once in awhile. Dana Evans' next sin is to tolerate the unheard of relationship between her fiance, Jeff, and his ex-wife, who just happens to be a perfect ten in every way. Dana questions in her mind, to her credit, but she sure is a whole lot more patient than any American woman I know. As Dana chases a murder story that winds up getting top government officials to tell her things that they have never told anyone (and this while she is a Star Reporter!), her son is first a troublemaker and then neglected at home. Nonetheless, our heroine plunges forth, reveals all, and there is a nice, homey, happy ending that - well, that left me nauseated. Don't waste your time on this one, I imagine Sidney Sheldon fans are pretty disappointed, because I would hate to think this is a sample of his work.",Lousy.,1.0,0
5,35405,"I was on board for the entire series. I didn't care for the small chapters jumping back and forth, it made a disconnect between the characters for me. The sudden, and I mean sudden, demise of a strong female character ( don't want to say any names) doesn't make her any stronger by her self sacrifice. I happened just about the time you figured out what was going on.Usually I'll reread a book several times, as I have all of the other books in the series. Not this one. I was shocked, disappointed and unsatisfied with the entire book and think it could have gone in a much different direction and could even have been a follow up story. A huge reader who is faithful to characters. Hate seeing Four left out in the cold all over again.Ironically, this is the very first negative review I have ever written.",unhappy,1.0,0
6,33133,"In this round, Four transforms into a fourteen year old girl with a princess poster on his wall, Tris continues to have every awesome trait pounded away from her person, and hundreds of pages are dedicated to the same brain numbing sermon, bad science, and destruction of the word genetics. We get it. She's totally into sacrifice, and if someone isn't loudly martyred at the end, the book will only be 30% waterlogged with Christian propaganda.I saw the end of Season Five of Buffy. That was a pretty good hero-death sacrifice that broke my heart and blew my mind. I read the Game of the Thrones series. That was a great one with multiple first person narrators and incredible human sacrifice, building towards some ultimate greater good. Both of these series still have my heart. People are not angry because of the events of the ending; they are angry because the ending was pointless, the book is poorly written, and much of the big reveals are utter nonsense. This was just a mess from a writer perhaps pushed too hard by her publisher to finish something quickly, and as a result took every easy exit away from her loyal fans.",George RR Martin makes a better George RR Martin,1.0,0
7,48789,"I hated this book.  I can't think of a nicer way to put it.  The author completely changes the plot of JANE EYRE, and to change the plot of the original is a total no-no.  I am surprised that anyone published this monstrosity.  If I could give zero stars, I would.  None of the characters remain true to the way Bronte depicted them, and I believe she would be sickened by what Emma Tennant did to her novel.  I only finished it to see how much worse it would get, and believe me, it got a lot worse before it was over.",Absolutely Hideous,1.0,0

Very touching,funny,sad,many emotions felt while reading this book.Yes,Frank had a depressing childhood but he shares  it with us in a very colourful way.There's no doubt that the poverty he  lived in was appaling but this book is not just a story where another Irish  child grows up in a slum and goes nowhere.He shares his dreams,his  thoughts,his longing to be someone and go somewhere.  He tells this story  in such a delightful way that you can't help reading on.For those of you  who cannot hear an Irish speaking voice in your head I recommend you listen  to this on the cassette that is available.This book is very moving and very  well written.If you liked this book then please read the follow on called  'Tis.",Very touching,4.0,1
