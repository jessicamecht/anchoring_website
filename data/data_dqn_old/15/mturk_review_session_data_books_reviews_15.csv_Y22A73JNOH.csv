1,28566,"What a shame that this book is not better than what it is. There is some serious potential here that is hampered by poor writing and other issues. This novel is plagued with poor grammar and spelling mistakes. While normally this would not warrant a negative review, it only compounds the issue. Having to re-read sentences again to figure out what word they meant to use just takes away from the enjoyment and immersion into the story.The author tries so hard to force us to believe that the main character is such a bad person that it comes across as laughable and something from a B movie on a Saturday night. The author goes out of the way to tell you, over and over and over that this guy is bad; he goes into a tavern; and he wants to fight people; he attacks a town and wants to kill people; he wants to do bad things. Chapter after chapter we are forced to read that yes this guy does bad things. We get it, he is a bad person. Sections of the book are almost laughable in how we are told how bad he is and groan worthy in others. You get to the point that not only do you want to root for the main character; you are actually kind of rooting for hoping he gets killed, which is not what the author wants you to feel. You are supposed to believe he can be redeemed, instead, you are cheering for the wrong side for all the wrong reasons. Avoid this mess of a book.",You will root for the wrong side in this mess of a novel,1.0,0

It shares none of these characteristics of good teaching memoirs.

5,42113,"Well, I think Margaret Mitchell could have used a realy good editor.  I don't mind reading long books quite the contrary I assure you, but well, one tiers of hearing yet another story about Scarlett doing something or another that gets her scorned by the people so they gossipe and Melly has to stop them.  One time is enough!The story line for those few people who do not know it is the following:  The young Scarlett O'Hara who is the favorit of all men falls in love with her friend Ashely Wilks who marries his cousin Melanie (Melly).  Scarlett wants to hurt Ashley so she marrys his brother who soon after they are married dies in the war.  Then Scarlett earns the scorne of the populus of Atlanta with her scandales behavior.Melly has a painfull childbirth and Scarlett takes her to Tara (her home) as the Yankkees march into Atlanta Georga.  To Melly this kind act of careing for her wins her undieing respect.The story continues from here but I will not.  The rest of the book centers around Scarlett and Rhett Butler and their feelings towareds eachother.I do not want to give the wronge impression it is not a bad book or even a book I disliked, it was great to read on the nine hour plane flight fom Budapest, but, after the plane ride was over and I still had 300 pages left I felt like I was wadding through quick sand to fininsh.  If I had been on the plane for about 2 and a half more hours I would not feel this way but back home where I had so many other book to read I began to look at it as a waste of time.  I am glad however that I have read it.  Though I would have certenly looked at it in a more appeling light had it been hacked down about 300 pages.",Fiddle-de-dee,3.0,0

7,32010,"I wasn't the biggest fan of Divergent, but decided to continue with the series out of curiosity. I was less than pleased with Insurgent. While full of action and suspense, it was not always clear why certain actions were being taken. Tris was bouncing around from compound to compound throughout the novel, but in the end, I'm not sure half of that was necessary. The plot lacked continuity for me. The characters are nearly impossible to keep track of without taking notes of some sort. Almost all seemed to have originated from one faction and transferred to another, making it hard to remember who originated from where. Is it just me, or was faction switching made out to be more rare in Divergent? Suddenly all characters have switched factions. Throughout the novel, I found myself more annoyed by Tris than rooting for her. Half the time her logic was quite questionable as well. Needless to say, I was disappointed in Insurgent. Several times I contemplated shelving it for good. Perhaps it's meant for a more juvenile audience (I'm 22). I will not continue onto the third book, I've suffered enough.",Not a fan,1.0,0

9,5103,"This book series began strongly, and I was definitely hooked. I burned through the first three in probably less than 2 weeks. I love the genre, and the characters really grew on me. I wanted to know where they (and the realm) would end up.What I began noticing, however, was that George Martin's writing tends towards being a whole lot of words about nothing. No furtherance of major plot points. No grand character arcs, as those who you hold onto tightest end up being killed off for nothing. It gets to a point where you don't care about any of them anymore, because who knows a)what the overall PLOT of the book is, and b)who will even be around 5 chapters later.Gag me if I have to read 20 zillion more pages about extraneous scene descriptions. I ended up skipping pages at a time because they consisted entirely of descriptive fluff. What else made my eyes roll? All the ""turning his head and spat""s and ""bit his/her tongue so hard he/she tasted blood""s. Talk about repetitive literary tricks. It's the complete opposite of the word 'creative'. Martin's writing is cliche and tired.I feel as though I wasted my time and money with A Dance With Dragons. Absolutely nothing gets resolved; as it was in A Feast for Crows, only more questions are raised. I was a fan, but now I'm definitely a hater. Heed my review and save your money.

First, the book is extremely repetitive, about HIS torture, HIS ability to survive. Very little mention of others in camp with him. He is very full of himself - how positive his attitude was (and how those that died had bad attitudes), how he had a higher threshold of pain that another soldier. Well, that soldier happened to be experiencing what we now call waterboarding, and we now know NOBODY can sustain for more than a few minutes. How dare he?He was very negative about the military, and how they should have told the freed POWs not to eat so much because it would cause illness further down the road. How were they to know?Honestly, there are much better accounts of this that you will walk away with a feeling of inspiration rather than dislike of the writer.

18,46181,"Synopsis of the book: Biochemical pathways are incredibly intricate.  I (Michael Behe) can't imagine how gradual evolution based on random mutations could have led to the formation of these pathways.  Therefore, there must be a Creator.We have heard similar arguments over and over again -- there is nothing new in this book.  Such an argument is obviously very very weak.  First of all, perhaps Michael Behe is just not imaginative/smart enough.  Furthermore, even if not a single scientist in the world can satisfactorily explain how biochemical pathways could have evolved by natural selection, it still doesn't mean that it could not have happened.  All it means is that scientists still don't know everything.BTW, I am a Bible-believing Christian, but I am also a scientist.  I firmly believe in a Creator and in the Book of Genesis, and when I finally see a book providing solid evidence against evolution based solely on natural selection, I will be the first to recommend it.  Unfortunately, it's clear that this book by Behe is bad science.  Behe is actually a respected biochemist with publications in high-profile journals (and therefore his description in this book of all those intricate biochemical events *IS* good science), but speculating the origins of life is not within his expertise.  It would be okay if Behe were only saying that he PERSONALLY doesn't believe in natural selection-based evolution, but he is now pretending that he has PROVEN it wrong with concrete scientific evidence.",Nothing new.....yawn.....,1.0,0

This book, which is a sequel from Divergent, adds almost nothing to the first.First, the opening is lame. It jumps right into the story just like it is the next chapter of the last book. It does not give you some reminiscence from the previous book.And then the story. The plot is just about Tris making one stupid mistake continued with another stupid mistake, but turns out to be OK later. She is not a divergent to me, she is just the luckiest person, which never pay for the consequences (yes, her parent died, but she turns out to be OK anyway. She is not torn apart).And the character development, I can simply say: None. Tris stays being Tris, Tobias being Tobias. The writer also does not seem to be interested in giving her audience the raison d'tre of the act.One ingredient of any fantasy/sci-fi novel is the world development. She has done well in development in the first book, but somehow it stopped there.So no story, no character development, no world developmnet, equals to nothing.Sorry Veronica, you fail this one.",An unnecessary sequel,1.0,0
