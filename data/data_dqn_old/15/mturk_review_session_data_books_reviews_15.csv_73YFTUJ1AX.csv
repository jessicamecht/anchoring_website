1,28566,"What a shame that this book is not better than what it is. There is some serious potential here that is hampered by poor writing and other issues. This novel is plagued with poor grammar and spelling mistakes. While normally this would not warrant a negative review, it only compounds the issue. Having to re-read sentences again to figure out what word they meant to use just takes away from the enjoyment and immersion into the story.The author tries so hard to force us to believe that the main character is such a bad person that it comes across as laughable and something from a B movie on a Saturday night. The author goes out of the way to tell you, over and over and over that this guy is bad; he goes into a tavern; and he wants to fight people; he attacks a town and wants to kill people; he wants to do bad things. Chapter after chapter we are forced to read that yes this guy does bad things. We get it, he is a bad person. Sections of the book are almost laughable in how we are told how bad he is and groan worthy in others. You get to the point that not only do you want to root for the main character; you are actually kind of rooting for hoping he gets killed, which is not what the author wants you to feel. You are supposed to believe he can be redeemed, instead, you are cheering for the wrong side for all the wrong reasons. Avoid this mess of a book.",You will root for the wrong side in this mess of a novel,1.0,0

3,32576,"I loved Divergent, but absolutely hated this book. How much torture, battering, and damage can a persons body take and never give up. Every few pages there was some new drug being shot into Tris neck and she was being battered in some way.No real story, just a lot of torture and thinking up new ways to inflict more.  And the most lame ending after wbat bappened I have ever hear. I hate a book where you feel like it is all being thought up only as it goes along and when they feel that it has gone on long enough the wind it up and a nice little bow on the last two pages. Even though it got tied up, it was a stupid ending thst was really no ending at all. I will not make the mistake of thinking that the next book will be any good either.

4,18210,"I was quite disappointed with the Constant Princess after having LOVED The Other Boleyn Girl and The Queens' Fool and having enjoyed The Virgin's Lover (although it wasn't as good as the previous two).What can be seen as a prequel to The Other Boleyn Girl, this novel tells the story of Catalina, Infanta of Spain, Princess of Wales as she moves to England from her beloved Spain to marry Prince Arthur and eventually become the Queen of England, her lifelong goal as we are so frequently reminded. The author breaks from her usual writing style to introduce Catalina's thoughts in the form of stream-of-consciousness rants which interrupt the third person storyteller every few pages or so. It is completely distracting and did nothing but take away from the telling of the story.What could have been an extremely riviting tale became boring and monotonous- pages upon pages described simply her idolization of her parents King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella and her ""especial relationship"" with her G-d which proved she was born to be Queen of England, despite what she had to go through to claim her title.Additionally, about 2/3 of the way through the novel it shifted from a love story/hardship story to a novel about plotting and waging a war, which was utterly boring and disjointed.I hope the author can return to the greatness of her prior novels (The Other Boleyn Girl, The Queens Fool).  If her subsequent novels are going the direction of this one, I will no longer be reading them.",Skip this one but definitely read her others...,1.0,0
5,42113,"Well, I think Margaret Mitchell could have used a realy good editor.  I don't mind reading long books quite the contrary I assure you, but well, one tiers of hearing yet another story about Scarlett doing something or another that gets her scorned by the people so they gossipe and Melly has to stop them.  One time is enough!The story line for those few people who do not know it is the following:  The young Scarlett O'Hara who is the favorit of all men falls in love with her friend Ashely Wilks who marries his cousin Melanie (Melly).  Scarlett wants to hurt Ashley so she marrys his brother who soon after they are married dies in the war.  Then Scarlett earns the scorne of the populus of Atlanta with her scandales behavior.Melly has a painfull childbirth and Scarlett takes her to Tara (her home) as the Yankkees march into Atlanta Georga.  To Melly this kind act of careing for her wins her undieing respect.The story continues from here but I will not.  The rest of the book centers around Scarlett and Rhett Butler and their feelings towareds eachother.I do not want to give the wronge impression it is not a bad book or even a book I disliked, it was great to read on the nine hour plane flight fom Budapest, but, after the plane ride was over and I still had 300 pages left I felt like I was wadding through quick sand to fininsh.  If I had been on the plane for about 2 and a half more hours I would not feel this way but back home where I had so many other book to read I began to look at it as a waste of time.  I am glad however that I have read it.  Though I would have certenly looked at it in a more appeling light had it been hacked down about 300 pages.",Fiddle-de-dee,3.0,0

7,32010,"I wasn't the biggest fan of Divergent, but decided to continue with the series out of curiosity. I was less than pleased with Insurgent. While full of action and suspense, it was not always clear why certain actions were being taken. Tris was bouncing around from compound to compound throughout the novel, but in the end, I'm not sure half of that was necessary. The plot lacked continuity for me. The characters are nearly impossible to keep track of without taking notes of some sort. Almost all seemed to have originated from one faction and transferred to another, making it hard to remember who originated from where. Is it just me, or was faction switching made out to be more rare in Divergent? Suddenly all characters have switched factions. Throughout the novel, I found myself more annoyed by Tris than rooting for her. Half the time her logic was quite questionable as well. Needless to say, I was disappointed in Insurgent. Several times I contemplated shelving it for good. Perhaps it's meant for a more juvenile audience (I'm 22). I will not continue onto the third book, I've suffered enough.",Not a fan,1.0,0
8,30620,"I have to agree with many other reviewers that the final, 3rd book of the series is a great disappointment.

Here's hoping Roth goes on to another story and writes like the first two of this series again.",Disappointment,1.0,0
9,5103,"This book series began strongly, and I was definitely hooked. I burned through the first three in probably less than 2 weeks. I love the genre, and the characters really grew on me. I wanted to know where they (and the realm) would end up.What I began noticing, however, was that George Martin's writing tends towards being a whole lot of words about nothing. No furtherance of major plot points. No grand character arcs, as those who you hold onto tightest end up being killed off for nothing. It gets to a point where you don't care about any of them anymore, because who knows a)what the overall PLOT of the book is, and b)who will even be around 5 chapters later.Gag me if I have to read 20 zillion more pages about extraneous scene descriptions. I ended up skipping pages at a time because they consisted entirely of descriptive fluff. What else made my eyes roll? All the ""turning his head and spat""s and ""bit his/her tongue so hard he/she tasted blood""s. Talk about repetitive literary tricks. It's the complete opposite of the word 'creative'. Martin's writing is cliche and tired.I feel as though I wasted my time and money with A Dance With Dragons. Absolutely nothing gets resolved; as it was in A Feast for Crows, only more questions are raised. I was a fan, but now I'm definitely a hater. Heed my review and save your money.

12,27885,"What is great about this book, ""Lost in Shangri-La: A True Story of Survival, Adventure, and the Most Incredible Rescue Mission of World War II,"" is that it is non-fiction that reads like fiction.  I am a fiction junkie, and, sometimes, am turned off by nonfiction pieces.  They just don't hold my interest.For those readers who don't like to read non-fiction, as sometimes (unfortunately) it tends to be a bit boring, this book is for you.  The wonderful thing about fiction is that it enthralls the reader and wraps him/her up in the story. You lose time, and just wallow in the woven words.This book does the same, and has the benefit of being true.  The author, Mitchell Zuckoff, has written several non-fiction books, and after diving into this one, I'll be sure to check them out.I don't wish to rehash the plot or summarize the events (better reviewers than I already took care of that detail).  Instead, block out some time, and prepare for the journey back to 1945, to discover the improbable story of survival for yourself.  What's incredible is that this story was forgotten...forgotten by time and by man.  Rediscover it.  If you can order it via the Vine program, I recommend you do so, or wait until it is released later this year.  The pictures add so much to the story as well, and are situated throughout the entire text.Enjoy, folks.  You won't regret it.",Wonderful...what an awesome book!,5.0,1

First, the book is extremely repetitive, about HIS torture, HIS ability to survive. Very little mention of others in camp with him. He is very full of himself - how positive his attitude was (and how those that died had bad attitudes), how he had a higher threshold of pain that another soldier. Well, that soldier happened to be experiencing what we now call waterboarding, and we now know NOBODY can sustain for more than a few minutes. How dare he?He was very negative about the military, and how they should have told the freed POWs not to eat so much because it would cause illness further down the road. How were they to know?Honestly, there are much better accounts of this that you will walk away with a feeling of inspiration rather than dislike of the writer.

Into his life comes a book written by 13 year old Pete Lomax (although it took him 2 years to write the book and he began it when he was 12 - so he should be at least 14) about the abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents and the pedophiles they sold him to. Pete has been listening to Gabriel's show and admires him very much.Well, Gabe calls up little Pete and begins a friendship. He tells  Pete all his personal problems and Pete sympathizes and gives him  advice.Later, he begins to doubt Pete's existence because no one has ever seen him. He lives with his adoptive mom Donna - sometimes she's a PhD psychologist, and sometimes she's a psychiatrist (MD) - according to Gabe anyway. (Gabe also has a lot of issues with his Dad - which are neatly resolved by the end).The movie version goes into much more depth, and is much spookier and actually thought provoking regarding Donna' motives, without dwelling on unnecessary sexual descriptions and details that are important on Gabe's agenda.It's unlikely that anyone would believe that a 13 year old boy would listen to NPR, or even know what it was. Much less have the patience to listen to a grown man's whining about his love life.See the movie.","For Once, the Movie is Better Than the Book",2.0,0
