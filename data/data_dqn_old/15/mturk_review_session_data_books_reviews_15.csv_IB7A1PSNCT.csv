1,28566,"What a shame that this book is not better than what it is. There is some serious potential here that is hampered by poor writing and other issues. This novel is plagued with poor grammar and spelling mistakes. While normally this would not warrant a negative review, it only compounds the issue. Having to re-read sentences again to figure out what word they meant to use just takes away from the enjoyment and immersion into the story.The author tries so hard to force us to believe that the main character is such a bad person that it comes across as laughable and something from a B movie on a Saturday night. The author goes out of the way to tell you, over and over and over that this guy is bad; he goes into a tavern; and he wants to fight people; he attacks a town and wants to kill people; he wants to do bad things. Chapter after chapter we are forced to read that yes this guy does bad things. We get it, he is a bad person. Sections of the book are almost laughable in how we are told how bad he is and groan worthy in others. You get to the point that not only do you want to root for the main character; you are actually kind of rooting for hoping he gets killed, which is not what the author wants you to feel. You are supposed to believe he can be redeemed, instead, you are cheering for the wrong side for all the wrong reasons. Avoid this mess of a book.",You will root for the wrong side in this mess of a novel,1.0,0

3,18210,"I was quite disappointed with the Constant Princess after having LOVED The Other Boleyn Girl and The Queens' Fool and having enjoyed The Virgin's Lover (although it wasn't as good as the previous two).What can be seen as a prequel to The Other Boleyn Girl, this novel tells the story of Catalina, Infanta of Spain, Princess of Wales as she moves to England from her beloved Spain to marry Prince Arthur and eventually become the Queen of England, her lifelong goal as we are so frequently reminded. The author breaks from her usual writing style to introduce Catalina's thoughts in the form of stream-of-consciousness rants which interrupt the third person storyteller every few pages or so. It is completely distracting and did nothing but take away from the telling of the story.What could have been an extremely riviting tale became boring and monotonous- pages upon pages described simply her idolization of her parents King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella and her ""especial relationship"" with her G-d which proved she was born to be Queen of England, despite what she had to go through to claim her title.Additionally, about 2/3 of the way through the novel it shifted from a love story/hardship story to a novel about plotting and waging a war, which was utterly boring and disjointed.I hope the author can return to the greatness of her prior novels (The Other Boleyn Girl, The Queens Fool).  If her subsequent novels are going the direction of this one, I will no longer be reading them.",Skip this one but definitely read her others...,1.0,0

5,42113,"Well, I think Margaret Mitchell could have used a realy good editor.  I don't mind reading long books quite the contrary I assure you, but well, one tiers of hearing yet another story about Scarlett doing something or another that gets her scorned by the people so they gossipe and Melly has to stop them.  One time is enough!The story line for those few people who do not know it is the following:  The young Scarlett O'Hara who is the favorit of all men falls in love with her friend Ashely Wilks who marries his cousin Melanie (Melly).  Scarlett wants to hurt Ashley so she marrys his brother who soon after they are married dies in the war.  Then Scarlett earns the scorne of the populus of Atlanta with her scandales behavior.Melly has a painfull childbirth and Scarlett takes her to Tara (her home) as the Yankkees march into Atlanta Georga.  To Melly this kind act of careing for her wins her undieing respect.The story continues from here but I will not.  The rest of the book centers around Scarlett and Rhett Butler and their feelings towareds eachother.I do not want to give the wronge impression it is not a bad book or even a book I disliked, it was great to read on the nine hour plane flight fom Budapest, but, after the plane ride was over and I still had 300 pages left I felt like I was wadding through quick sand to fininsh.  If I had been on the plane for about 2 and a half more hours I would not feel this way but back home where I had so many other book to read I began to look at it as a waste of time.  I am glad however that I have read it.  Though I would have certenly looked at it in a more appeling light had it been hacked down about 300 pages.",Fiddle-de-dee,3.0,0

Easy for me to say, but Terry can typically keep you entranced with his imagination and fascinating characters...  This felt like a very dumbed down book with 3 very good chunks...

15,46181,"Synopsis of the book: Biochemical pathways are incredibly intricate.  I (Michael Behe) can't imagine how gradual evolution based on random mutations could have led to the formation of these pathways.  Therefore, there must be a Creator.We have heard similar arguments over and over again -- there is nothing new in this book.  Such an argument is obviously very very weak.  First of all, perhaps Michael Behe is just not imaginative/smart enough.  Furthermore, even if not a single scientist in the world can satisfactorily explain how biochemical pathways could have evolved by natural selection, it still doesn't mean that it could not have happened.  All it means is that scientists still don't know everything.BTW, I am a Bible-believing Christian, but I am also a scientist.  I firmly believe in a Creator and in the Book of Genesis, and when I finally see a book providing solid evidence against evolution based solely on natural selection, I will be the first to recommend it.  Unfortunately, it's clear that this book by Behe is bad science.  Behe is actually a respected biochemist with publications in high-profile journals (and therefore his description in this book of all those intricate biochemical events *IS* good science), but speculating the origins of life is not within his expertise.  It would be okay if Behe were only saying that he PERSONALLY doesn't believe in natural selection-based evolution, but he is now pretending that he has PROVEN it wrong with concrete scientific evidence.",Nothing new.....yawn.....,1.0,1

18,28328,"I cant get behind a book that has the main character raping girls in the first few pages.No thanks, I am good.I have read a lot of books with rape in them, but I have to say they were mostly with a female protagonist.One of my favorite fantasy series The Deed of Paksenarrion Paks lets herself be tortured for five days and nights, and rape isn't the only thing that she has to suffer.I understood why the character did this, I also understood why the author wrote the story the way she did.I can see why an author will do this to their female leads, it can make them stronger, give them motivation to become the best they can be to fight evil in whatever form it comes in.There are a couple of reasons I have issues with the main character being rapist, the first being the obvious. I cannot empathize with a rapist, there isn't a good enough reason in the world for me to like a person that commits such a crime. I can't think of another author that has had their main character act in the way Jorg has.This leads into my second reason for disliking the course of actions of this book. It's an easy out, a cheap shot in making the main character be evil, and he is evil, this is not the actions of an anti-hero. I like a good anti-hero, I enjoy the show Dexter, and Richard Kadrey writes a mean one with his Sandman Slim series.I like books where the author takes time to build the story so the reader and the character get to know each other and settle their differences.In this book there isn't time, the author just jumped right in with this disgusting display to portray what a horrible man Jorg is.This is why I will not be reading this book, it's not all the reasons, but it's the top two.",No thank you.,1.0,0

21,60289,"Gabriel Noone is a 53 year old gay man with his own radio show which comes on at 11 PM. He's upset because his lover of 10 years has left because he needed space. Into his life comes a book written by 13 year old Pete Lomax (although it took him 2 years to write the book and he began it when he was 12 - so he should be at least 14) about the abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents and the pedophiles they sold him to. Pete has been listening to Gabriel's show and admires him very much.Well, Gabe calls up little Pete and begins a friendship. He tells  Pete all his personal problems and Pete sympathizes and gives him  advice.Later, he begins to doubt Pete's existence because no one has ever seen him. He lives with his adoptive mom Donna - sometimes she's a PhD psychologist, and sometimes she's a psychiatrist (MD) - according to Gabe anyway. (Gabe also has a lot of issues with his Dad - which are neatly resolved by the end).The movie version goes into much more depth, and is much spookier and actually thought provoking regarding Donna' motives, without dwelling on unnecessary sexual descriptions and details that are important on Gabe's agenda.It's unlikely that anyone would believe that a 13 year old boy would listen to NPR, or even know what it was. Much less have the patience to listen to a grown man's whining about his love life.See the movie.","For Once, the Movie is Better Than the Book",2.0,0

I do find it funny that some people are criticizing the prejudices some of the characters have, really? Those prejudices were far more interesting than this crap of a book. I don't care if it's a best setter, I don't care if Agatha Christie is a big shot.
