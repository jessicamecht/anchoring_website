1,55337,Don't bother with this book - it is truly an insult to one's intelligence - I can't beleive this trash was published as a &quot;bestseller&quot;!I had to force myself through it in the hope that one of the numerous (badly timed &amp; totally irrelevant) asides would actually have one iota of humour.You can't sympathize with the main character (or indeed give 2 hoots about ANY of the characters) because they are so transparently paper thin &amp; predictable.Don't waste your time.

5,60706,"Please don't buy this book unless you don't mind 200+ pages of Anti-American, Pro-Communist diatribe! The first part of the book was okay, although I found the voice shifts irksome after a while (okay, only Adah's). Perhaps most tiresome, though, is the attempt to have the Price family be the embodiment of all whites (the Prices were especially bigoted and ignorant).(FYI, Barbara Kingsolver, not all Christians are evil missionaries. The last part of the book tries to imply that anything Christian is bad.)The second half, however, was highly annoying with it's continual Anti-American sentiment. But funny, too, because of the hypocracy of the author: (1) Just because the Congolese do things differently than Americans doesn't mean they're bad or stupid: they're just different, so don't judge. (2) Anything done the way of American norms is not Congolese and is therefore BADYOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS!!!Perhaps the saddest thing was that I didn't care a fig for what happened to the Price women",I'm glad I didn't pay full price!,2.0,0

8,30620,"I have to agree with many other reviewers that the final, 3rd book of the series is a great disappointment. I think Roth was finished with the second book but pushed by the money mongers to write a third. The voices of Tris and Tobias are indistiguishable. The ending disappointing to be kind. Here's hoping Roth goes on to another story and writes like the first two of this series again.",Disappointment,1.0,0
9,5103,"This book series began strongly, and I was definitely hooked. I burned through the first three in probably less than 2 weeks. I love the genre, and the characters really grew on me. I wanted to know where they (and the realm) would end up.What I began noticing, however, was that George Martin's writing tends towards being a whole lot of words about nothing. No furtherance of major plot points. No grand character arcs, as those who you hold onto tightest end up being killed off for nothing. It gets to a point where you don't care about any of them anymore, because who knows a)what the overall PLOT of the book is, and b)who will even be around 5 chapters later.Gag me if I have to read 20 zillion more pages about extraneous scene descriptions. I ended up skipping pages at a time because they consisted entirely of descriptive fluff. What else made my eyes roll? All the ""turning his head and spat""s and ""bit his/her tongue so hard he/she tasted blood""s. Talk about repetitive literary tricks. It's the complete opposite of the word 'creative'. Martin's writing is cliche and tired.I feel as though I wasted my time and money with A Dance With Dragons. Absolutely nothing gets resolved; as it was in A Feast for Crows, only more questions are raised. I was a fan, but now I'm definitely a hater. Heed my review and save your money.

This book seems like it was written in a hurry and not as well thought out as the first two books. I have not enjoyed this one as much as the first two at all.

15,46181,"Synopsis of the book: Biochemical pathways are incredibly intricate.  I (Michael Behe) can't imagine how gradual evolution based on random mutations could have led to the formation of these pathways.  Therefore, there must be a Creator.We have heard similar arguments over and over again -- there is nothing new in this book.  Such an argument is obviously very very weak.  First of all, perhaps Michael Behe is just not imaginative/smart enough.  Furthermore, even if not a single scientist in the world can satisfactorily explain how biochemical pathways could have evolved by natural selection, it still doesn't mean that it could not have happened.  All it means is that scientists still don't know everything.BTW, I am a Bible-believing Christian, but I am also a scientist.  I firmly believe in a Creator and in the Book of Genesis, and when I finally see a book providing solid evidence against evolution based solely on natural selection, I will be the first to recommend it.  Unfortunately, it's clear that this book by Behe is bad science.  Behe is actually a respected biochemist with publications in high-profile journals (and therefore his description in this book of all those intricate biochemical events *IS* good science), but speculating the origins of life is not within his expertise.  It would be okay if Behe were only saying that he PERSONALLY doesn't believe in natural selection-based evolution, but he is now pretending that he has PROVEN it wrong with concrete scientific evidence.",Nothing new.....yawn.....,1.0,0

18,28328,"I cant get behind a book that has the main character raping girls in the first few pages.No thanks, I am good.I have read a lot of books with rape in them, but I have to say they were mostly with a female protagonist.One of my favorite fantasy series The Deed of Paksenarrion Paks lets herself be tortured for five days and nights, and rape isn't the only thing that she has to suffer.I understood why the character did this, I also understood why the author wrote the story the way she did.I can see why an author will do this to their female leads, it can make them stronger, give them motivation to become the best they can be to fight evil in whatever form it comes in.There are a couple of reasons I have issues with the main character being rapist, the first being the obvious. I cannot empathize with a rapist, there isn't a good enough reason in the world for me to like a person that commits such a crime. I can't think of another author that has had their main character act in the way Jorg has.This leads into my second reason for disliking the course of actions of this book. It's an easy out, a cheap shot in making the main character be evil, and he is evil, this is not the actions of an anti-hero. I like a good anti-hero, I enjoy the show Dexter, and Richard Kadrey writes a mean one with his Sandman Slim series.I like books where the author takes time to build the story so the reader and the character get to know each other and settle their differences.In this book there isn't time, the author just jumped right in with this disgusting display to portray what a horrible man Jorg is.This is why I will not be reading this book, it's not all the reasons, but it's the top two.",No thank you.,1.0,1
19,32170,"The first book is not perfect, but at least it is readable. This one is a big flop, which ensure me not to continue reading the next installment. This book, which is a sequel from Divergent, adds almost nothing to the first.First, the opening is lame. It jumps right into the story just like it is the next chapter of the last book. It does not give you some reminiscence from the previous book.And then the story. The plot is just about Tris making one stupid mistake continued with another stupid mistake, but turns out to be OK later. She is not a divergent to me, she is just the luckiest person, which never pay for the consequences (yes, her parent died, but she turns out to be OK anyway. She is not torn apart).And the character development, I can simply say: None. Tris stays being Tris, Tobias being Tobias. The writer also does not seem to be interested in giving her audience the raison d'tre of the act.One ingredient of any fantasy/sci-fi novel is the world development. She has done well in development in the first book, but somehow it stopped there.So no story, no character development, no world developmnet, equals to nothing.Sorry Veronica, you fail this one.",An unnecessary sequel,1.0,1

21,60289,"Gabriel Noone is a 53 year old gay man with his own radio show which comes on at 11 PM. He's upset because his lover of 10 years has left because he needed space. Into his life comes a book written by 13 year old Pete Lomax (although it took him 2 years to write the book and he began it when he was 12 - so he should be at least 14) about the abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents and the pedophiles they sold him to. Pete has been listening to Gabriel's show and admires him very much.Well, Gabe calls up little Pete and begins a friendship. He tells  Pete all his personal problems and Pete sympathizes and gives him  advice.Later, he begins to doubt Pete's existence because no one has ever seen him. He lives with his adoptive mom Donna - sometimes she's a PhD psychologist, and sometimes she's a psychiatrist (MD) - according to Gabe anyway. (Gabe also has a lot of issues with his Dad - which are neatly resolved by the end).The movie version goes into much more depth, and is much spookier and actually thought provoking regarding Donna' motives, without dwelling on unnecessary sexual descriptions and details that are important on Gabe's agenda.It's unlikely that anyone would believe that a 13 year old boy would listen to NPR, or even know what it was. Much less have the patience to listen to a grown man's whining about his love life.See the movie.","For Once, the Movie is Better Than the Book",2.0,1
