1,55337,Don't bother with this book - it is truly an insult to one's intelligence - I can't beleive this trash was published as a &quot;bestseller&quot;!I had to force myself through it in the hope that one of the numerous (badly timed &amp; totally irrelevant) asides would actually have one iota of humour.You can't sympathize with the main character (or indeed give 2 hoots about ANY of the characters) because they are so transparently paper thin &amp; predictable.Don't waste your time. I know I have. This was a very disappointing offering from a usually quite talented author.,Pathetic waste of time!,1.0,0
2,34963,"What was Roth thinking!?! This trilogy had so much potential! She blew it. I had to drag myself through this one. Book 1 was great, book 2 was pretty good, book 3 bombed. I'm so disappointed! Bad, bad way to end this series. Ugh.",Wow. Bad Ending.,1.0,0

5,18210,"I was quite disappointed with the Constant Princess after having LOVED The Other Boleyn Girl and The Queens' Fool and having enjoyed The Virgin's Lover (although it wasn't as good as the previous two).What can be seen as a prequel to The Other Boleyn Girl, this novel tells the story of Catalina, Infanta of Spain, Princess of Wales as she moves to England from her beloved Spain to marry Prince Arthur and eventually become the Queen of England, her lifelong goal as we are so frequently reminded. The author breaks from her usual writing style to introduce Catalina's thoughts in the form of stream-of-consciousness rants which interrupt the third person storyteller every few pages or so. It is completely distracting and did nothing but take away from the telling of the story.What could have been an extremely riviting tale became boring and monotonous- pages upon pages described simply her idolization of her parents King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella and her ""especial relationship"" with her G-d which proved she was born to be Queen of England, despite what she had to go through to claim her title.Additionally, about 2/3 of the way through the novel it shifted from a love story/hardship story to a novel about plotting and waging a war, which was utterly boring and disjointed.I hope the author can return to the greatness of her prior novels (The Other Boleyn Girl, The Queens Fool).  If her subsequent novels are going the direction of this one, I will no longer be reading them.",Skip this one but definitely read her others...,1.0,0
6,60706,"Please don't buy this book unless you don't mind 200+ pages of Anti-American, Pro-Communist diatribe! The first part of the book was okay, although I found the voice shifts irksome after a while (okay, only Adah's). Perhaps most tiresome, though, is the attempt to have the Price family be the embodiment of all whites (the Prices were especially bigoted and ignorant).(FYI, Barbara Kingsolver, not all Christians are evil missionaries. The last part of the book tries to imply that anything Christian is bad.)The second half, however, was highly annoying with it's continual Anti-American sentiment. But funny, too, because of the hypocracy of the author: (1) Just because the Congolese do things differently than Americans doesn't mean they're bad or stupid: they're just different, so don't judge. (2) Anything done the way of American norms is not Congolese and is therefore BADYOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS!!!Perhaps the saddest thing was that I didn't care a fig for what happened to the Price women",I'm glad I didn't pay full price!,2.0,0
7,45451,"Once you understand Zen, everything else flows naturally in your life. In my opinion, you don't need to be told ZEN this and ZEN that in your daily life. The author, though well-intentioned, has written a comprehensive book that in the end says the same thing thousands of times.Sit quietly for 20-minutes a day and try not to think about anything. Be compassionate to others around you, enjoy and appreciate each moment and live in the present - if you do these things, you AREpracticing ZEN.

8,32010,"I wasn't the biggest fan of Divergent, but decided to continue with the series out of curiosity. I was less than pleased with Insurgent. While full of action and suspense, it was not always clear why certain actions were being taken. Tris was bouncing around from compound to compound throughout the novel, but in the end, I'm not sure half of that was necessary. The plot lacked continuity for me. The characters are nearly impossible to keep track of without taking notes of some sort. Almost all seemed to have originated from one faction and transferred to another, making it hard to remember who originated from where. Is it just me, or was faction switching made out to be more rare in Divergent? Suddenly all characters have switched factions. Throughout the novel, I found myself more annoyed by Tris than rooting for her. Half the time her logic was quite questionable as well. Needless to say, I was disappointed in Insurgent. Several times I contemplated shelving it for good. Perhaps it's meant for a more juvenile audience (I'm 22). I will not continue onto the third book, I've suffered enough.",Not a fan,1.0,0
9,30620,"I have to agree with many other reviewers that the final, 3rd book of the series is a great disappointment. I think Roth was finished with the second book but pushed by the money mongers to write a third. The voices of Tris and Tobias are indistiguishable. The ending disappointing to be kind. Here's hoping Roth goes on to another story and writes like the first two of this series again.",Disappointment,1.0,0
10,5103,"This book series began strongly, and I was definitely hooked. I burned through the first three in probably less than 2 weeks. I love the genre, and the characters really grew on me. I wanted to know where they (and the realm) would end up.What I began noticing, however, was that George Martin's writing tends towards being a whole lot of words about nothing. No furtherance of major plot points. No grand character arcs, as those who you hold onto tightest end up being killed off for nothing. It gets to a point where you don't care about any of them anymore, because who knows a)what the overall PLOT of the book is, and b)who will even be around 5 chapters later.Gag me if I have to read 20 zillion more pages about extraneous scene descriptions. I ended up skipping pages at a time because they consisted entirely of descriptive fluff. What else made my eyes roll? All the ""turning his head and spat""s and ""bit his/her tongue so hard he/she tasted blood""s. Talk about repetitive literary tricks. It's the complete opposite of the word 'creative'. Martin's writing is cliche and tired.I feel as though I wasted my time and money with A Dance With Dragons. Absolutely nothing gets resolved; as it was in A Feast for Crows, only more questions are raised. I was a fan, but now I'm definitely a hater. Heed my review and save your money. That day/week/whatever of your life you spend reading this garbage, you will never be able to get back.",A Whole Lot of NOTHING,1.0,0
11,28201,"James Patterson is quoted as describing this book as a thriller.  I have read three quarters of it and it doesn't stack up to any other thriller I have read.  There are discordant threads that don't appear to be able to connect to each other - murder, child pornography, child on child physical abuse, etc., etc.And I assume that the story of Agnes, who gave birth in 1924, is going to connect to the contemporaneous characters of today.And the poor stone cutter!(Perhaps my views will change when I finish reading the book.)","""Thriller?""",2.0,0

19,46355,"I've read other accounts of the Bataan Death March and POW stories of those held in Japanese war camps. This is the first one that I truly didn't like. First, the book is extremely repetitive, about HIS torture, HIS ability to survive. Very little mention of others in camp with him. He is very full of himself - how positive his attitude was (and how those that died had bad attitudes), how he had a higher threshold of pain that another soldier. Well, that soldier happened to be experiencing what we now call waterboarding, and we now know NOBODY can sustain for more than a few minutes. How dare he?He was very negative about the military, and how they should have told the freed POWs not to eat so much because it would cause illness further down the road. How were they to know?Honestly, there are much better accounts of this that you will walk away with a feeling of inspiration rather than dislike of the writer. Ghost Soldiers happens to be one of them.",Skip it - he does a terrible disservice to other POWs,1.0,0

22,49233,"I agree with another reviewer who felt that this book sets a tedious pace that is frequently bogged down by constantly rehashing the ups and downs of Henry's divorce trial, first from Catherine of Aragon's point of view and then Anne Boleyns. While the amount of material regarding Catherine of Aragon is enormous the writer does stop often to compliment himself (tasteless) and by the time Anne Boleyn comes on the scene the reader is exhausted.","In depth study of Henry's motivations, Catherine of Aragon",2.0,0

First of all, it's written in some British-style only a few people could enjoy, Secondly, Agatha Christie is not a horror writer, she doesn't know how to do it. I do find it funny that some people are criticizing the prejudices some of the characters have, really? Those prejudices were far more interesting than this crap of a book. I don't care if it's a best setter, I don't care if Agatha Christie is a big shot.
