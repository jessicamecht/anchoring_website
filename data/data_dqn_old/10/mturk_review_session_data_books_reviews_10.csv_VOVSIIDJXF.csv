I haven't cried Thu  much since reading Mocking Jay or the last few books of Harry Potter. it's  not easy to make me cry but Veronica Roth has done it. Fantastic book!",Amazing,5.0,1
2,53948,"""Mr. Paradise"" has its moments, like when the Top Ten Dumb Criminals list comes up, or when Kelly, the beautiful model, sees through Frank the homicide detective immediately, or when Frank tries to concentrate on the crimes he's investigating rather than on Kelly's beautiful body.And then, of course, is the whole idea of the ""almost"" twins play-acting as topless cheerleaders for Mr. Paradise. Or the flip of the coin by Paradise to see who gets which one. (Some TV show loves to depict women jumping on trampolines. Same appeal.)Leonard aficionados will expect the worst, and they'd be right. One chopped up body, cut in six parts by a chain saw. One bungled stock transaction. Three criminals, three shots at a ""business"" meeting. Enough blood and bungling for even the choosiest of Leonard critics.

3,24718,"A difficult, but important, story that needs to be told. This is the biography of Louis Zamperini, Olympic runner and American hero. Some of this is so horrific that I found myself having to put it aside and take a breather, but it has a great finish. Do continue to the very end. The title says it all: A Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption. Every American should read this book.",Amazing and Important,5.0,0
4,14142,"I bought this book because of the wonderful reviews and publicity it received.  YIKES!!!  Was I disappointed!  If Chabon had submitted any part of this book as a freshman English paper, he would have received an ""F"" for his diction.  The story was interesting and I did finish it, but the language was forced and jerky in its tempo.  It is a strange time to be a Jew ...or not...",A strange time indeed...,1.0,0
5,9003,"This was all plots and plans and no action. While it might have pictured what life was actually like in the Boleyn/Howard family, there was no action to it -- and I know that ""plots and plans"" can actually make a decent book, because ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" proves it!Thankfully, I didn't buy this book alone (I bought it at the same time I bought ""The Queen's Fool""), or I would've discounted Ms. Gregory as a truly boring author altogether. Hopefully, this book was just a fluke and her others (like ""The Constant Princess"" and ""The Virgin's Lover"") are just as good as ""The Queen's Fool"".",Bored Out of My Gourd,1.0,0
6,27722,"I was very interested to read Zuckoff's ""Lost in Shangri-La.""  I'm a sucker for non-fiction accounts about people doing things or surviving experiences that are foreign to me.  For this reason, I picked up this book with a great deal of excitement.  I was sorely disappointed.I was looking forward to reading about how a group of plane crash survivors braved through a foreign jungle, fighting animals and cannibals, to eventually make their way back to civilization.  The reviews and book jacket made it read like a thrilling adventure in the heart of the jungle, with lots of action and suspense.  What I got was something much different.Spoiler alert!  Do not read on if you don't want some of the book spoiled for you!The survivors don't have to trek that far before they make it to a clearing. They basically stay there until they are rescued.  The natives are not restless, nor all that cannibalistic.  Basically, they are simple, kind people who take an interest in helping the survivors.  They are eventually rescued by a daring glider-related escape.  This was one of the only truly entertaining parts of the book for me.TThere was also too much background information on people that didn't need to be told.  We didn't need to know all the background info (birthplace, former jobs, marital status, etc.) on the press corps that covered the story, or other characters that weren't survivors.  I ended up skipping through much of it to get to the end.If you are really into true-life adventure stories, I highly recommend that you check out Jon Krakauer's booksInto Thin Air (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)andInto the Wild.  They are gripping, tightly told, and exhilarating reads.  Another interesting read isThe Lost City of Z: A Tale of Deadly Obsession in the Amazon, about a man who journeys into the Amazon.  I recommend these much more than Zuckoff's book.","Not enough of a gripping, compelling story",2.0,0
7,33133,"In this round, Four transforms into a fourteen year old girl with a princess poster on his wall, Tris continues to have every awesome trait pounded away from her person, and hundreds of pages are dedicated to the same brain numbing sermon, bad science, and destruction of the word genetics. We get it. She's totally into sacrifice, and if someone isn't loudly martyred at the end, the book will only be 30% waterlogged with Christian propaganda.I saw the end of Season Five of Buffy. That was a pretty good hero-death sacrifice that broke my heart and blew my mind. I read the Game of the Thrones series. That was a great one with multiple first person narrators and incredible human sacrifice, building towards some ultimate greater good. Both of these series still have my heart. People are not angry because of the events of the ending; they are angry because the ending was pointless, the book is poorly written, and much of the big reveals are utter nonsense. This was just a mess from a writer perhaps pushed too hard by her publisher to finish something quickly, and as a result took every easy exit away from her loyal fans.",George RR Martin makes a better George RR Martin,1.0,0

9,14374,"What an embarrassing disaster for this author and publisher. Had they bothered to have the book read by anyone who knows anything about German history, they would have gotten some helpful comments. Gaines reduces the very real statebuilding accomplishments of the Hohenzollern family to a mixture of scurrilous gossip and prurient commentary. There are numerous mistakes in the part of the book that have to do with Protestant history (e.g., neither Ulrich Zwingli nor Thomas Muentzer were Anabaptists), when the author is not merely repeating nostalgic hearsay about its various events. He is totally ignorant of the social context of a number of the compositions he discusses (e.g., saying it that was daring of Bach to compose a piece with the title ""God is my kind"" for a civic occasion--actually, such pieces were customary and commissioned in order to heighten the civic consciousness of the burghers who sponsored them). After 150 pp. of nonsense and error, I was no longer sympathetic to his larger argument. Too bad the publisher didn't find a better manuscript on early modern German cultural history, since it is a fascinating topic. Unfortunately reading this book conveys no sense of its fascination. I'd give it zero if that were an option.",A mixture of error and scurrilous gossip,1.0,0
