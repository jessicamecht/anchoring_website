1,6158,Have tried several of the recipes - always good.  Have gifted the book twice with a waffle maker and a couple of utensils - great shower gift.  Biggest reason for me to own it - display it front and center of my cookbook collection.  It is attractive and very small - a great addition with fabulous pictures to accompany delicious recipes.,Great recipes and attractive to display.,5.0,1
2,36093,"Dear V. Roth (an open letter)It is you.  Like an ex that one is afraid to admit having ever loved, I propose the following:1- you take a writing class (really) I read the Legend series and the Maze Runner series also and know when an author has ...2- We agree never to see each other again.  You can keep my money, but be aware that it is the last bit of money you will ever see from me again...3- I will agree to see better writers4- I will NOT recommend this series to my YA readers (it was that bad)Signed, Scrapper","It is not me, it is you",1.0,0

4,14142,"I bought this book because of the wonderful reviews and publicity it received.  YIKES!!!  Was I disappointed!  If Chabon had submitted any part of this book as a freshman English paper, he would have received an ""F"" for his diction.  The story was interesting and I did finish it, but the language was forced and jerky in its tempo.  It is a strange time to be a Jew ...or not...",A strange time indeed...,1.0,0
5,9003,"This was all plots and plans and no action. While it might have pictured what life was actually like in the Boleyn/Howard family, there was no action to it -- and I know that ""plots and plans"" can actually make a decent book, because ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" proves it!Thankfully, I didn't buy this book alone (I bought it at the same time I bought ""The Queen's Fool""), or I would've discounted Ms. Gregory as a truly boring author altogether. Hopefully, this book was just a fluke and her others (like ""The Constant Princess"" and ""The Virgin's Lover"") are just as good as ""The Queen's Fool"".",Bored Out of My Gourd,1.0,0
6,61873,"I'm afraid I could not get through this book.  I read the prologue and  first two chapters and put it down.  I rarely do that with a book.  It  wasn't making much sense to me.  It was somewhat of a downer and I like to  be entertained when I read.  Also I just don't like four letter words.  I  don't think authors have to use that language in their books.  Other books  by Anne Rivers Siddons are much, much better.",Couldn't get through it,1.0,1
7,8293,"Since I only read 50 pages, I'm not sure that it is fair for me to review, but I have read some very long books and enjoyed them.  This book is NOWHERE after 50 pages, and it was painful to even get that far.  Each character is described in excruciating detail - not by actions, but simply by words and their own thoughts.  This really helped me to appreciate authors like Terry Brooks and Terry Goodkind who can describe characters as the story grows, so that something is happening as you read.  After all, it is our actions that define us...",Ssssllllloooowwww starting,2.0,0
8,1025,I have no idea what the hoopla is about but I find this book to be just alright at best. It is a little slow. The characters didnt have any passion or oomph. It was just very blah to me. I do like Reese Witherspoon and Rob so maybe the movie will be more entertaining.,It was just alright,2.0,1
9,48987,"I disliked the whiplash this book gave me. It's like author was on speed trying to cover Boston, prion, Tampa, Cuba in one hook. Along with social instabilities and sociopathic gangsters we Cuban tobacco farms, war ships. Ridiculous plot. Author should stick to writing about Patrick.",the most ridiculous Forrest Gump saga I've read.,1.0,0
