0,3100,"in for whom the bell tolls hemingway looks at war from the individuals perspective. his army is a rag tag group of guerrilla fighters, not the army. the time and setting is the spanish civil war. a general understanding of that war is helpful. the characters include mostly local insurgents and one american mercenary. the horrors of war are portrayed on both sides with neither having the higher moral ground.it is also a study of courage in the face of potential death. this is developed not only through the underlying theme of war, but the stories of some of the characters earlier lives which include bull fighting and the running of the bulls.the one drawback to the book is the stilted language used in the dialog of the novel (including the refusal to use obscenities).a book well worth the read",profiles in courage,4.0,1
1,37080,"A Game Of thrones was a fantastic book. While I didn't like A Clash Of Kings, it was still an okay book. A Storm Of Swords is one of the best fantasy books ever written. So what happened? GRRM is a good writer. He may make mistakes, and he may over describe things at times, but he's a good writer nonetheless. ................ So why does this book (And the fifth book) SUCK? I don't know. But It's awful. I don't really know what I can say that hasn't been said, so I'm just going to finish the review now.",The downfall of the series,1.0,0
2,53948,"""Mr. Paradise"" has its moments, like when the Top Ten Dumb Criminals list comes up, or when Kelly, the beautiful model, sees through Frank the homicide detective immediately, or when Frank tries to concentrate on the crimes he's investigating rather than on Kelly's beautiful body.And then, of course, is the whole idea of the ""almost"" twins play-acting as topless cheerleaders for Mr. Paradise. Or the flip of the coin by Paradise to see who gets which one. (Some TV show loves to depict women jumping on trampolines. Same appeal.)Leonard aficionados will expect the worst, and they'd be right. One chopped up body, cut in six parts by a chain saw. One bungled stock transaction. Three criminals, three shots at a ""business"" meeting. Enough blood and bungling for even the choosiest of Leonard critics.

3,3528,There aren't many public school novels being written and read these days. Rowling's Potter series is an exception (and in my opinion they are not all that good). However if you are old enough to have read Tom Brown's Schooldays then the Flaashman series may be of interest. If you have enjoyed Kipling's Indian stories then Flashman is also worth a try.,For kiplomaniacs,5.0,0
4,17647,"Frank McCourt is a wonderfull story teller.I can almost hear that Irish accent as i read this book!  Very touching,funny,sad,many emotions felt while reading this book.Yes,Frank had a depressing childhood but he shares  it with us in a very colourful way.There's no doubt that the poverty he  lived in was appaling but this book is not just a story where another Irish  child grows up in a slum and goes nowhere.He shares his dreams,his  thoughts,his longing to be someone and go somewhere.  He tells this story  in such a delightful way that you can't help reading on.For those of you  who cannot hear an Irish speaking voice in your head I recommend you listen  to this on the cassette that is available.This book is very moving and very  well written.If you liked this book then please read the follow on called  'Tis.",Very touching,4.0,1

If Chabon had submitted any part of this book as a freshman English paper, he would have received an ""F"" for his diction.

7,8477,"I have read many of Lisa's books, and have enjoyed them.  But, this one comes across as so contrived --- too many things just fall into place -- and everything is wrapped up much too quickly at the end.  It seems impossible to me that there would be enough organ donors in the city of Philadelphia to sway an election.  Marta is beaten up within an inch of her life, and still jumps in the car and drives to the Jersey Shore --------- very implausible.  And, the ending seems thrown together in an attempt to sweep up all the debris.",Too contrived,2.0,0
8,6946,"This book does have some worthy insights, however the author tends to pigeonhole people into oversimplified categories according to the ""games"" they play to get their needs met.  In real life however, I think people are more likely to fall into various roles, or games, at different times in their lives. Something about the presentation seemed just a little pretentious, too. The author sometimes appeared to think he was giving away some secret bits of information, heretofore known only by him or a few select others.  This left a bad taste in my mouth.  Nonetheless, some of the information presented was very valid, and at the very least the book serves as an excellent reminder that we are all afraid of rejection, no matter who we are.  But we are not all ""losers"", in spite of the games we play; I don't think the author gives enough emphasis to this fact.  In addition, I think that sometimes life is just what it is, and looking at it like it is some kind of game is of no useful value whatsoever.  Watch out if you think you are having some kind of ""aha!"" experience, as it will be short-lived.",Worth giving a look,3.0,1
9,48789,"I hated this book.  I can't think of a nicer way to put it.  The author completely changes the plot of JANE EYRE, and to change the plot of the original is a total no-no.  I am surprised that anyone published this monstrosity.  If I could give zero stars, I would.  None of the characters remain true to the way Bronte depicted them, and I believe she would be sickened by what Emma Tennant did to her novel.  I only finished it to see how much worse it would get, and believe me, it got a lot worse before it was over.",Absolutely Hideous,1.0,0
