1,55337,Don't bother with this book - it is truly an insult to one's intelligence - I can't beleive this trash was published as a &quot;bestseller&quot;!I had to force myself through it in the hope that one of the numerous (badly timed &amp; totally irrelevant) asides would actually have one iota of humour.You can't sympathize with the main character (or indeed give 2 hoots about ANY of the characters) because they are so transparently paper thin &amp; predictable.Don't waste your time. I know I have. This was a very disappointing offering from a usually quite talented author.,Pathetic waste of time!,1.0,0
2,32576,"I loved Divergent, but absolutely hated this book. How much torture, battering, and damage can a persons body take and never give up. Every few pages there was some new drug being shot into Tris neck and she was being battered in some way.No real story, just a lot of torture and thinking up new ways to inflict more.  And the most lame ending after wbat bappened I have ever hear. I hate a book where you feel like it is all being thought up only as it goes along and when they feel that it has gone on long enough the wind it up and a nice little bow on the last two pages. Even though it got tied up, it was a stupid ending thst was really no ending at all. I will not make the mistake of thinking that the next book will be any good either.

4,18210,"I was quite disappointed with the Constant Princess after having LOVED The Other Boleyn Girl and The Queens' Fool and having enjoyed The Virgin's Lover (although it wasn't as good as the previous two).What can be seen as a prequel to The Other Boleyn Girl, this novel tells the story of Catalina, Infanta of Spain, Princess of Wales as she moves to England from her beloved Spain to marry Prince Arthur and eventually become the Queen of England, her lifelong goal as we are so frequently reminded. The author breaks from her usual writing style to introduce Catalina's thoughts in the form of stream-of-consciousness rants which interrupt the third person storyteller every few pages or so. It is completely distracting and did nothing but take away from the telling of the story.What could have been an extremely riviting tale became boring and monotonous- pages upon pages described simply her idolization of her parents King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella and her ""especial relationship"" with her G-d which proved she was born to be Queen of England, despite what she had to go through to claim her title.Additionally, about 2/3 of the way through the novel it shifted from a love story/hardship story to a novel about plotting and waging a war, which was utterly boring and disjointed.I hope the author can return to the greatness of her prior novels (The Other Boleyn Girl, The Queens Fool).  If her subsequent novels are going the direction of this one, I will no longer be reading them.",Skip this one but definitely read her others...,1.0,0
5,60706,"Please don't buy this book unless you don't mind 200+ pages of Anti-American, Pro-Communist diatribe! The first part of the book was okay, although I found the voice shifts irksome after a while (okay, only Adah's). Perhaps most tiresome, though, is the attempt to have the Price family be the embodiment of all whites (the Prices were especially bigoted and ignorant).(FYI, Barbara Kingsolver, not all Christians are evil missionaries. The last part of the book tries to imply that anything Christian is bad.)The second half, however, was highly annoying with it's continual Anti-American sentiment. But funny, too, because of the hypocracy of the author: (1) Just because the Congolese do things differently than Americans doesn't mean they're bad or stupid: they're just different, so don't judge. (2) Anything done the way of American norms is not Congolese and is therefore BADYOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS!!!Perhaps the saddest thing was that I didn't care a fig for what happened to the Price women",I'm glad I didn't pay full price!,2.0,0

7,32010,"I wasn't the biggest fan of Divergent, but decided to continue with the series out of curiosity. I was less than pleased with Insurgent. While full of action and suspense, it was not always clear why certain actions were being taken. Tris was bouncing around from compound to compound throughout the novel, but in the end, I'm not sure half of that was necessary. The plot lacked continuity for me. The characters are nearly impossible to keep track of without taking notes of some sort. Almost all seemed to have originated from one faction and transferred to another, making it hard to remember who originated from where. Is it just me, or was faction switching made out to be more rare in Divergent? Suddenly all characters have switched factions. Throughout the novel, I found myself more annoyed by Tris than rooting for her. Half the time her logic was quite questionable as well. Needless to say, I was disappointed in Insurgent. Several times I contemplated shelving it for good. Perhaps it's meant for a more juvenile audience (I'm 22). I will not continue onto the third book, I've suffered enough.",Not a fan,1.0,0

12,27885,"What is great about this book, ""Lost in Shangri-La: A True Story of Survival, Adventure, and the Most Incredible Rescue Mission of World War II,"" is that it is non-fiction that reads like fiction.  I am a fiction junkie, and, sometimes, am turned off by nonfiction pieces.  They just don't hold my interest.For those readers who don't like to read non-fiction, as sometimes (unfortunately) it tends to be a bit boring, this book is for you.  The wonderful thing about fiction is that it enthralls the reader and wraps him/her up in the story. You lose time, and just wallow in the woven words.This book does the same, and has the benefit of being true.  The author, Mitchell Zuckoff, has written several non-fiction books, and after diving into this one, I'll be sure to check them out.I don't wish to rehash the plot or summarize the events (better reviewers than I already took care of that detail).  Instead, block out some time, and prepare for the journey back to 1945, to discover the improbable story of survival for yourself.  What's incredible is that this story was forgotten...forgotten by time and by man.  Rediscover it.  If you can order it via the Vine program, I recommend you do so, or wait until it is released later this year.  The pictures add so much to the story as well, and are situated throughout the entire text.Enjoy, folks.  You won't regret it.",Wonderful...what an awesome book!,5.0,1

This book seems like it was written in a hurry and not as well thought out as the first two books. I have not enjoyed this one as much as the first two at all.

Having said that, I put this book down two-thirds of the way through, sickened by the author's apparent fascination with torture and its various medieval devices.

19,28328,"I cant get behind a book that has the main character raping girls in the first few pages.No thanks, I am good.I have read a lot of books with rape in them, but I have to say they were mostly with a female protagonist.One of my favorite fantasy series The Deed of Paksenarrion Paks lets herself be tortured for five days and nights, and rape isn't the only thing that she has to suffer.I understood why the character did this, I also understood why the author wrote the story the way she did.I can see why an author will do this to their female leads, it can make them stronger, give them motivation to become the best they can be to fight evil in whatever form it comes in.There are a couple of reasons I have issues with the main character being rapist, the first being the obvious. I cannot empathize with a rapist, there isn't a good enough reason in the world for me to like a person that commits such a crime. I can't think of another author that has had their main character act in the way Jorg has.This leads into my second reason for disliking the course of actions of this book. It's an easy out, a cheap shot in making the main character be evil, and he is evil, this is not the actions of an anti-hero. I like a good anti-hero, I enjoy the show Dexter, and Richard Kadrey writes a mean one with his Sandman Slim series.I like books where the author takes time to build the story so the reader and the character get to know each other and settle their differences.In this book there isn't time, the author just jumped right in with this disgusting display to portray what a horrible man Jorg is.This is why I will not be reading this book, it's not all the reasons, but it's the top two.",No thank you.,1.0,0

21,60289,"Gabriel Noone is a 53 year old gay man with his own radio show which comes on at 11 PM. He's upset because his lover of 10 years has left because he needed space. Into his life comes a book written by 13 year old Pete Lomax (although it took him 2 years to write the book and he began it when he was 12 - so he should be at least 14) about the abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents and the pedophiles they sold him to. Pete has been listening to Gabriel's show and admires him very much.Well, Gabe calls up little Pete and begins a friendship. He tells  Pete all his personal problems and Pete sympathizes and gives him  advice.Later, he begins to doubt Pete's existence because no one has ever seen him. He lives with his adoptive mom Donna - sometimes she's a PhD psychologist, and sometimes she's a psychiatrist (MD) - according to Gabe anyway. (Gabe also has a lot of issues with his Dad - which are neatly resolved by the end).The movie version goes into much more depth, and is much spookier and actually thought provoking regarding Donna' motives, without dwelling on unnecessary sexual descriptions and details that are important on Gabe's agenda.It's unlikely that anyone would believe that a 13 year old boy would listen to NPR, or even know what it was. Much less have the patience to listen to a grown man's whining about his love life.See the movie.","For Once, the Movie is Better Than the Book",2.0,0
