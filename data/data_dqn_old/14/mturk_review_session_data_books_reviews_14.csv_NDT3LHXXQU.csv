1,28566,"What a shame that this book is not better than what it is. There is some serious potential here that is hampered by poor writing and other issues. This novel is plagued with poor grammar and spelling mistakes. While normally this would not warrant a negative review, it only compounds the issue. Having to re-read sentences again to figure out what word they meant to use just takes away from the enjoyment and immersion into the story.The author tries so hard to force us to believe that the main character is such a bad person that it comes across as laughable and something from a B movie on a Saturday night. The author goes out of the way to tell you, over and over and over that this guy is bad; he goes into a tavern; and he wants to fight people; he attacks a town and wants to kill people; he wants to do bad things. Chapter after chapter we are forced to read that yes this guy does bad things. We get it, he is a bad person. Sections of the book are almost laughable in how we are told how bad he is and groan worthy in others. You get to the point that not only do you want to root for the main character; you are actually kind of rooting for hoping he gets killed, which is not what the author wants you to feel. You are supposed to believe he can be redeemed, instead, you are cheering for the wrong side for all the wrong reasons. Avoid this mess of a book.",You will root for the wrong side in this mess of a novel,1.0,0

It shares none of these characteristics of good teaching memoirs. It seemed as though McCourt would rather have been in a prison in Mozambique than in a classroom, would rather have been spending his time with a cockraoch than with students.Truly abysmal.

Every few pages there was some new drug being shot into Tris neck and she was being battered in some way.No real story, just a lot of torture and thinking up new ways to inflict more.  And the most lame ending after wbat bappened I have ever hear. I hate a book where you feel like it is all being thought up only as it goes along and when they feel that it has gone on long enough the wind it up and a nice little bow on the last two pages.

5,60706,"Please don't buy this book unless you don't mind 200+ pages of Anti-American, Pro-Communist diatribe! The first part of the book was okay, although I found the voice shifts irksome after a while (okay, only Adah's). Perhaps most tiresome, though, is the attempt to have the Price family be the embodiment of all whites (the Prices were especially bigoted and ignorant).(FYI, Barbara Kingsolver, not all Christians are evil missionaries. The last part of the book tries to imply that anything Christian is bad.)The second half, however, was highly annoying with it's continual Anti-American sentiment. But funny, too, because of the hypocracy of the author: (1) Just because the Congolese do things differently than Americans doesn't mean they're bad or stupid: they're just different, so don't judge. (2) Anything done the way of American norms is not Congolese and is therefore BADYOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS!!!Perhaps the saddest thing was that I didn't care a fig for what happened to the Price women",I'm glad I didn't pay full price!,2.0,0

I think Roth was finished with the second book but pushed by the money mongers to write a third. The voices of Tris and Tobias are indistiguishable. The ending disappointing to be kind. Here's hoping Roth goes on to another story and writes like the first two of this series again.",Disappointment,1.0,0
9,5103,"This book series began strongly, and I was definitely hooked. I burned through the first three in probably less than 2 weeks. I love the genre, and the characters really grew on me. I wanted to know where they (and the realm) would end up.What I began noticing, however, was that George Martin's writing tends towards being a whole lot of words about nothing. No furtherance of major plot points. No grand character arcs, as those who you hold onto tightest end up being killed off for nothing. It gets to a point where you don't care about any of them anymore, because who knows a)what the overall PLOT of the book is, and b)who will even be around 5 chapters later.Gag me if I have to read 20 zillion more pages about extraneous scene descriptions. I ended up skipping pages at a time because they consisted entirely of descriptive fluff. What else made my eyes roll? All the ""turning his head and spat""s and ""bit his/her tongue so hard he/she tasted blood""s. Talk about repetitive literary tricks. It's the complete opposite of the word 'creative'. Martin's writing is cliche and tired.I feel as though I wasted my time and money with A Dance With Dragons. Absolutely nothing gets resolved; as it was in A Feast for Crows, only more questions are raised. I was a fan, but now I'm definitely a hater. Heed my review and save your money.

10,28201,"James Patterson is quoted as describing this book as a thriller.  I have read three quarters of it and it doesn't stack up to any other thriller I have read.  There are discordant threads that don't appear to be able to connect to each other - murder, child pornography, child on child physical abuse, etc., etc.And I assume that the story of Agnes, who gave birth in 1924, is going to connect to the contemporaneous characters of today.And the poor stone cutter!(Perhaps my views will change when I finish reading the book.)","""Thriller?""",2.0,0
11,27885,"What is great about this book, ""Lost in Shangri-La: A True Story of Survival, Adventure, and the Most Incredible Rescue Mission of World War II,"" is that it is non-fiction that reads like fiction.  I am a fiction junkie, and, sometimes, am turned off by nonfiction pieces.  They just don't hold my interest.For those readers who don't like to read non-fiction, as sometimes (unfortunately) it tends to be a bit boring, this book is for you.  The wonderful thing about fiction is that it enthralls the reader and wraps him/her up in the story. You lose time, and just wallow in the woven words.This book does the same, and has the benefit of being true.  The author, Mitchell Zuckoff, has written several non-fiction books, and after diving into this one, I'll be sure to check them out.I don't wish to rehash the plot or summarize the events (better reviewers than I already took care of that detail).  Instead, block out some time, and prepare for the journey back to 1945, to discover the improbable story of survival for yourself.  What's incredible is that this story was forgotten...forgotten by time and by man.  Rediscover it.  If you can order it via the Vine program, I recommend you do so, or wait until it is released later this year.  The pictures add so much to the story as well, and are situated throughout the entire text.Enjoy, folks.  You won't regret it.",Wonderful...what an awesome book!,5.0,1

16,46181,"Synopsis of the book: Biochemical pathways are incredibly intricate.  I (Michael Behe) can't imagine how gradual evolution based on random mutations could have led to the formation of these pathways.  Therefore, there must be a Creator.We have heard similar arguments over and over again -- there is nothing new in this book.  Such an argument is obviously very very weak.  First of all, perhaps Michael Behe is just not imaginative/smart enough.  Furthermore, even if not a single scientist in the world can satisfactorily explain how biochemical pathways could have evolved by natural selection, it still doesn't mean that it could not have happened.  All it means is that scientists still don't know everything.BTW, I am a Bible-believing Christian, but I am also a scientist.  I firmly believe in a Creator and in the Book of Genesis, and when I finally see a book providing solid evidence against evolution based solely on natural selection, I will be the first to recommend it.  Unfortunately, it's clear that this book by Behe is bad science.  Behe is actually a respected biochemist with publications in high-profile journals (and therefore his description in this book of all those intricate biochemical events *IS* good science), but speculating the origins of life is not within his expertise.  It would be okay if Behe were only saying that he PERSONALLY doesn't believe in natural selection-based evolution, but he is now pretending that he has PROVEN it wrong with concrete scientific evidence.",Nothing new.....yawn.....,1.0,0

Having said that, I put this book down two-thirds of the way through, sickened by the author's apparent fascination with torture and its various medieval devices. The descriptions of torture machines and how they work on the human body are quite graphic, almost as if the author was truly enjoying herself while writing the descriptions.

19,28328,"I cant get behind a book that has the main character raping girls in the first few pages.No thanks, I am good.I have read a lot of books with rape in them, but I have to say they were mostly with a female protagonist.One of my favorite fantasy series The Deed of Paksenarrion Paks lets herself be tortured for five days and nights, and rape isn't the only thing that she has to suffer.I understood why the character did this, I also understood why the author wrote the story the way she did.I can see why an author will do this to their female leads, it can make them stronger, give them motivation to become the best they can be to fight evil in whatever form it comes in.There are a couple of reasons I have issues with the main character being rapist, the first being the obvious. I cannot empathize with a rapist, there isn't a good enough reason in the world for me to like a person that commits such a crime. I can't think of another author that has had their main character act in the way Jorg has.This leads into my second reason for disliking the course of actions of this book. It's an easy out, a cheap shot in making the main character be evil, and he is evil, this is not the actions of an anti-hero. I like a good anti-hero, I enjoy the show Dexter, and Richard Kadrey writes a mean one with his Sandman Slim series.I like books where the author takes time to build the story so the reader and the character get to know each other and settle their differences.In this book there isn't time, the author just jumped right in with this disgusting display to portray what a horrible man Jorg is.This is why I will not be reading this book, it's not all the reasons, but it's the top two.",No thank you.,1.0,0
