1,28566,"What a shame that this book is not better than what it is. There is some serious potential here that is hampered by poor writing and other issues. This novel is plagued with poor grammar and spelling mistakes. While normally this would not warrant a negative review, it only compounds the issue. Having to re-read sentences again to figure out what word they meant to use just takes away from the enjoyment and immersion into the story.The author tries so hard to force us to believe that the main character is such a bad person that it comes across as laughable and something from a B movie on a Saturday night. The author goes out of the way to tell you, over and over and over that this guy is bad; he goes into a tavern; and he wants to fight people; he attacks a town and wants to kill people; he wants to do bad things. Chapter after chapter we are forced to read that yes this guy does bad things. We get it, he is a bad person. Sections of the book are almost laughable in how we are told how bad he is and groan worthy in others. You get to the point that not only do you want to root for the main character; you are actually kind of rooting for hoping he gets killed, which is not what the author wants you to feel. You are supposed to believe he can be redeemed, instead, you are cheering for the wrong side for all the wrong reasons. Avoid this mess of a book.",You will root for the wrong side in this mess of a novel,1.0,0

It shares none of these characteristics of good teaching memoirs. It seemed as though McCourt would rather have been in a prison in Mozambique than in a classroom, would rather have been spending his time with a cockraoch than with students.Truly abysmal. Another decade of students has been lucky that McCourt found another career.",A teacher who hates teaching and hates kids,1.0,1

5,42113,"Well, I think Margaret Mitchell could have used a realy good editor.  I don't mind reading long books quite the contrary I assure you, but well, one tiers of hearing yet another story about Scarlett doing something or another that gets her scorned by the people so they gossipe and Melly has to stop them.  One time is enough!The story line for those few people who do not know it is the following:  The young Scarlett O'Hara who is the favorit of all men falls in love with her friend Ashely Wilks who marries his cousin Melanie (Melly).  Scarlett wants to hurt Ashley so she marrys his brother who soon after they are married dies in the war.  Then Scarlett earns the scorne of the populus of Atlanta with her scandales behavior.Melly has a painfull childbirth and Scarlett takes her to Tara (her home) as the Yankkees march into Atlanta Georga.  To Melly this kind act of careing for her wins her undieing respect.The story continues from here but I will not.  The rest of the book centers around Scarlett and Rhett Butler and their feelings towareds eachother.I do not want to give the wronge impression it is not a bad book or even a book I disliked, it was great to read on the nine hour plane flight fom Budapest, but, after the plane ride was over and I still had 300 pages left I felt like I was wadding through quick sand to fininsh.  If I had been on the plane for about 2 and a half more hours I would not feel this way but back home where I had so many other book to read I began to look at it as a waste of time.  I am glad however that I have read it.  Though I would have certenly looked at it in a more appeling light had it been hacked down about 300 pages.",Fiddle-de-dee,3.0,0

Easy for me to say, but Terry can typically keep you entranced with his imagination and fascinating characters...  This felt like a very dumbed down book with 3 very good chunks...

11,27885,"What is great about this book, ""Lost in Shangri-La: A True Story of Survival, Adventure, and the Most Incredible Rescue Mission of World War II,"" is that it is non-fiction that reads like fiction.  I am a fiction junkie, and, sometimes, am turned off by nonfiction pieces.  They just don't hold my interest.For those readers who don't like to read non-fiction, as sometimes (unfortunately) it tends to be a bit boring, this book is for you.  The wonderful thing about fiction is that it enthralls the reader and wraps him/her up in the story. You lose time, and just wallow in the woven words.This book does the same, and has the benefit of being true.  The author, Mitchell Zuckoff, has written several non-fiction books, and after diving into this one, I'll be sure to check them out.I don't wish to rehash the plot or summarize the events (better reviewers than I already took care of that detail).  Instead, block out some time, and prepare for the journey back to 1945, to discover the improbable story of survival for yourself.  What's incredible is that this story was forgotten...forgotten by time and by man.  Rediscover it.  If you can order it via the Vine program, I recommend you do so, or wait until it is released later this year.  The pictures add so much to the story as well, and are situated throughout the entire text.Enjoy, folks.  You won't regret it.",Wonderful...what an awesome book!,5.0,1

13,36464,"The first two books were written only from the perspective of Tris which was fine, but this book goes back and forth between the perspective of Tobias and Tris, and it's annoying.

15,46181,"Synopsis of the book: Biochemical pathways are incredibly intricate.  I (Michael Behe) can't imagine how gradual evolution based on random mutations could have led to the formation of these pathways.  Therefore, there must be a Creator.We have heard similar arguments over and over again -- there is nothing new in this book.  Such an argument is obviously very very weak.  First of all, perhaps Michael Behe is just not imaginative/smart enough.  Furthermore, even if not a single scientist in the world can satisfactorily explain how biochemical pathways could have evolved by natural selection, it still doesn't mean that it could not have happened.  All it means is that scientists still don't know everything.BTW, I am a Bible-believing Christian, but I am also a scientist.  I firmly believe in a Creator and in the Book of Genesis, and when I finally see a book providing solid evidence against evolution based solely on natural selection, I will be the first to recommend it.  Unfortunately, it's clear that this book by Behe is bad science.  Behe is actually a respected biochemist with publications in high-profile journals (and therefore his description in this book of all those intricate biochemical events *IS* good science), but speculating the origins of life is not within his expertise.  It would be okay if Behe were only saying that he PERSONALLY doesn't believe in natural selection-based evolution, but he is now pretending that he has PROVEN it wrong with concrete scientific evidence.",Nothing new.....yawn.....,1.0,0

18,28328,"I cant get behind a book that has the main character raping girls in the first few pages.No thanks, I am good.I have read a lot of books with rape in them, but I have to say they were mostly with a female protagonist.One of my favorite fantasy series The Deed of Paksenarrion Paks lets herself be tortured for five days and nights, and rape isn't the only thing that she has to suffer.I understood why the character did this, I also understood why the author wrote the story the way she did.I can see why an author will do this to their female leads, it can make them stronger, give them motivation to become the best they can be to fight evil in whatever form it comes in.There are a couple of reasons I have issues with the main character being rapist, the first being the obvious. I cannot empathize with a rapist, there isn't a good enough reason in the world for me to like a person that commits such a crime. I can't think of another author that has had their main character act in the way Jorg has.This leads into my second reason for disliking the course of actions of this book. It's an easy out, a cheap shot in making the main character be evil, and he is evil, this is not the actions of an anti-hero. I like a good anti-hero, I enjoy the show Dexter, and Richard Kadrey writes a mean one with his Sandman Slim series.I like books where the author takes time to build the story so the reader and the character get to know each other and settle their differences.In this book there isn't time, the author just jumped right in with this disgusting display to portray what a horrible man Jorg is.This is why I will not be reading this book, it's not all the reasons, but it's the top two.",No thank you.,1.0,0
