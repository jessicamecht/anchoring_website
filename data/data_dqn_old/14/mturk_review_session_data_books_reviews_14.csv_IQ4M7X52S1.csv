1,55337,Don't bother with this book - it is truly an insult to one's intelligence - I can't beleive this trash was published as a &quot;bestseller&quot;!I had to force myself through it in the hope that one of the numerous (badly timed &amp; totally irrelevant) asides would actually have one iota of humour.You can't sympathize with the main character (or indeed give 2 hoots about ANY of the characters) because they are so transparently paper thin &amp; predictable.Don't waste your time. I know I have. This was a very disappointing offering from a usually quite talented author.,Pathetic waste of time!,1.0,0
2,32576,"I loved Divergent, but absolutely hated this book. How much torture, battering, and damage can a persons body take and never give up. Every few pages there was some new drug being shot into Tris neck and she was being battered in some way.No real story, just a lot of torture and thinking up new ways to inflict more.  And the most lame ending after wbat bappened I have ever hear. I hate a book where you feel like it is all being thought up only as it goes along and when they feel that it has gone on long enough the wind it up and a nice little bow on the last two pages. Even though it got tied up, it was a stupid ending thst was really no ending at all. I will not make the mistake of thinking that the next book will be any good either. I will not buy another one of her bookd.",Insurgent,1.0,0

It shares none of these characteristics of good teaching memoirs.

5,60706,"Please don't buy this book unless you don't mind 200+ pages of Anti-American, Pro-Communist diatribe! The first part of the book was okay, although I found the voice shifts irksome after a while (okay, only Adah's). Perhaps most tiresome, though, is the attempt to have the Price family be the embodiment of all whites (the Prices were especially bigoted and ignorant).(FYI, Barbara Kingsolver, not all Christians are evil missionaries. The last part of the book tries to imply that anything Christian is bad.)The second half, however, was highly annoying with it's continual Anti-American sentiment. But funny, too, because of the hypocracy of the author: (1) Just because the Congolese do things differently than Americans doesn't mean they're bad or stupid: they're just different, so don't judge. (2) Anything done the way of American norms is not Congolese and is therefore BADYOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS!!!Perhaps the saddest thing was that I didn't care a fig for what happened to the Price women",I'm glad I didn't pay full price!,2.0,0

8,30620,"I have to agree with many other reviewers that the final, 3rd book of the series is a great disappointment. I think Roth was finished with the second book but pushed by the money mongers to write a third. The voices of Tris and Tobias are indistiguishable. The ending disappointing to be kind. Here's hoping Roth goes on to another story and writes like the first two of this series again.",Disappointment,1.0,0
9,5103,"This book series began strongly, and I was definitely hooked. I burned through the first three in probably less than 2 weeks. I love the genre, and the characters really grew on me. I wanted to know where they (and the realm) would end up.What I began noticing, however, was that George Martin's writing tends towards being a whole lot of words about nothing. No furtherance of major plot points. No grand character arcs, as those who you hold onto tightest end up being killed off for nothing. It gets to a point where you don't care about any of them anymore, because who knows a)what the overall PLOT of the book is, and b)who will even be around 5 chapters later.Gag me if I have to read 20 zillion more pages about extraneous scene descriptions. I ended up skipping pages at a time because they consisted entirely of descriptive fluff. What else made my eyes roll? All the ""turning his head and spat""s and ""bit his/her tongue so hard he/she tasted blood""s. Talk about repetitive literary tricks. It's the complete opposite of the word 'creative'. Martin's writing is cliche and tired.I feel as though I wasted my time and money with A Dance With Dragons. Absolutely nothing gets resolved; as it was in A Feast for Crows, only more questions are raised. I was a fan, but now I'm definitely a hater. Heed my review and save your money.

12,27885,"What is great about this book, ""Lost in Shangri-La: A True Story of Survival, Adventure, and the Most Incredible Rescue Mission of World War II,"" is that it is non-fiction that reads like fiction.  I am a fiction junkie, and, sometimes, am turned off by nonfiction pieces.  They just don't hold my interest.For those readers who don't like to read non-fiction, as sometimes (unfortunately) it tends to be a bit boring, this book is for you.  The wonderful thing about fiction is that it enthralls the reader and wraps him/her up in the story. You lose time, and just wallow in the woven words.This book does the same, and has the benefit of being true.  The author, Mitchell Zuckoff, has written several non-fiction books, and after diving into this one, I'll be sure to check them out.I don't wish to rehash the plot or summarize the events (better reviewers than I already took care of that detail).  Instead, block out some time, and prepare for the journey back to 1945, to discover the improbable story of survival for yourself.  What's incredible is that this story was forgotten...forgotten by time and by man.  Rediscover it.  If you can order it via the Vine program, I recommend you do so, or wait until it is released later this year.  The pictures add so much to the story as well, and are situated throughout the entire text.Enjoy, folks.  You won't regret it.",Wonderful...what an awesome book!,5.0,1
13,36464,"The first two books were written only from the perspective of Tris which was fine, but this book goes back and forth between the perspective of Tobias and Tris, and it's annoying. This book seems like it was written in a hurry and not as well thought out as the first two books. I have not enjoyed this one as much as the first two at all. I think she should have taken way more time writing this book and written it from ONE perspective like she did the first two books.

18,46355,"I've read other accounts of the Bataan Death March and POW stories of those held in Japanese war camps. This is the first one that I truly didn't like. First, the book is extremely repetitive, about HIS torture, HIS ability to survive. Very little mention of others in camp with him. He is very full of himself - how positive his attitude was (and how those that died had bad attitudes), how he had a higher threshold of pain that another soldier. Well, that soldier happened to be experiencing what we now call waterboarding, and we now know NOBODY can sustain for more than a few minutes. How dare he?He was very negative about the military, and how they should have told the freed POWs not to eat so much because it would cause illness further down the road. How were they to know?Honestly, there are much better accounts of this that you will walk away with a feeling of inspiration rather than dislike of the writer. Ghost Soldiers happens to be one of them.",Skip it - he does a terrible disservice to other POWs,1.0,0
19,32170,"The first book is not perfect, but at least it is readable. This one is a big flop, which ensure me not to continue reading the next installment. This book, which is a sequel from Divergent, adds almost nothing to the first.First, the opening is lame. It jumps right into the story just like it is the next chapter of the last book. It does not give you some reminiscence from the previous book.And then the story. The plot is just about Tris making one stupid mistake continued with another stupid mistake, but turns out to be OK later. She is not a divergent to me, she is just the luckiest person, which never pay for the consequences (yes, her parent died, but she turns out to be OK anyway. She is not torn apart).And the character development, I can simply say: None. Tris stays being Tris, Tobias being Tobias. The writer also does not seem to be interested in giving her audience the raison d'tre of the act.One ingredient of any fantasy/sci-fi novel is the world development. She has done well in development in the first book, but somehow it stopped there.So no story, no character development, no world developmnet, equals to nothing.Sorry Veronica, you fail this one.",An unnecessary sequel,1.0,0

21,60289,"Gabriel Noone is a 53 year old gay man with his own radio show which comes on at 11 PM. He's upset because his lover of 10 years has left because he needed space. Into his life comes a book written by 13 year old Pete Lomax (although it took him 2 years to write the book and he began it when he was 12 - so he should be at least 14) about the abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents and the pedophiles they sold him to. Pete has been listening to Gabriel's show and admires him very much.Well, Gabe calls up little Pete and begins a friendship. He tells  Pete all his personal problems and Pete sympathizes and gives him  advice.Later, he begins to doubt Pete's existence because no one has ever seen him. He lives with his adoptive mom Donna - sometimes she's a PhD psychologist, and sometimes she's a psychiatrist (MD) - according to Gabe anyway. (Gabe also has a lot of issues with his Dad - which are neatly resolved by the end).The movie version goes into much more depth, and is much spookier and actually thought provoking regarding Donna' motives, without dwelling on unnecessary sexual descriptions and details that are important on Gabe's agenda.It's unlikely that anyone would believe that a 13 year old boy would listen to NPR, or even know what it was. Much less have the patience to listen to a grown man's whining about his love life.See the movie.","For Once, the Movie is Better Than the Book",2.0,0

I do find it funny that some people are criticizing the prejudices some of the characters have, really? Those prejudices were far more interesting than this crap of a book.
