Even during a stop at a stop light coming home from work, I would get in a few pages. I definitely plan on reading his other book in the very near future! Highly recommended to all my friends and family. Don't waste your time with cookie-cutter authors whose books are always at Walmart and Target, buy Craig's book today, you will not be disappointed!",Stop everything and read this book!,5.0,1
1,57768,"I remember reading this in high school.  I felt totally different about it now, reading it as an adult.Talk about selfish and hypocritical.  Daisy was as selfish as they come. So dependent on money for her happiness.I really disliked her and Tom by the end of the book.  I really liked the story though.  F. Scott Fitzgerald was a great writer.",Feel differently reading this as an adult,4.0,1

3,12993,"This book is on the shelf withRadical Son: A Generational Odysseyand""I Heard You Paint Houses"": Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran and the Inside Story of the Mafia, the Teamsters, and the Last Ride of Jimmy Hoffa. This is a great memoir that illuminates both the man and his times. Regarding the man, if one would read Frasers,Quartered Safe Out Here: A Recollection of the War in Burma, IMHO one of the great war memoirs,and see the suffering, the privation, death and destruction related there; well, it might give some insight to the personality, the nature of the man many reviewers here find off putting and embarrassing. I guess when you run across an open field to take a Japanese position and you see friends fall dead around you, it may affect you. How then to deal with that? One way I feel is to come to believe (if you didn't earlier), that this suffering and loss must be for something big! Something worth fighting for.Perhaps England?As regards the times, as the years pass and one watches the country and way of life you fought for and your friends died for, spin down the drain like so much dirty water, well maybe if you had a set of balls you'ld be irate. Fraser sure was and from the outside looking in it appears he had good reason. The book is divided into three main themes, Angry Old Man (my favorite), guess what that's about? Interlude (second favorite), it's a kind of AOM lite, and Shooting Scripts, about his Hollywood days. This is a great memoir by an Angry Old Man. Deal with it!And if anyone from ESPN/Santana Sports sees this, how 'bout covering the SignPost race?",Man Lit For......errrr....Men,5.0,0
4,14374,"What an embarrassing disaster for this author and publisher. Had they bothered to have the book read by anyone who knows anything about German history, they would have gotten some helpful comments. Gaines reduces the very real statebuilding accomplishments of the Hohenzollern family to a mixture of scurrilous gossip and prurient commentary. There are numerous mistakes in the part of the book that have to do with Protestant history (e.g., neither Ulrich Zwingli nor Thomas Muentzer were Anabaptists), when the author is not merely repeating nostalgic hearsay about its various events. He is totally ignorant of the social context of a number of the compositions he discusses (e.g., saying it that was daring of Bach to compose a piece with the title ""God is my kind"" for a civic occasion--actually, such pieces were customary and commissioned in order to heighten the civic consciousness of the burghers who sponsored them). After 150 pp. of nonsense and error, I was no longer sympathetic to his larger argument. Too bad the publisher didn't find a better manuscript on early modern German cultural history, since it is a fascinating topic. Unfortunately reading this book conveys no sense of its fascination. I'd give it zero if that were an option.",A mixture of error and scurrilous gossip,1.0,0

6,9003,"This was all plots and plans and no action. While it might have pictured what life was actually like in the Boleyn/Howard family, there was no action to it -- and I know that ""plots and plans"" can actually make a decent book, because ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" proves it!Thankfully, I didn't buy this book alone (I bought it at the same time I bought ""The Queen's Fool""), or I would've discounted Ms. Gregory as a truly boring author altogether. Hopefully, this book was just a fluke and her others (like ""The Constant Princess"" and ""The Virgin's Lover"") are just as good as ""The Queen's Fool"".",Bored Out of My Gourd,1.0,0
7,61873,"I'm afraid I could not get through this book.  I read the prologue and  first two chapters and put it down.  I rarely do that with a book.  It  wasn't making much sense to me.  It was somewhat of a downer and I like to  be entertained when I read.  Also I just don't like four letter words.  I  don't think authors have to use that language in their books.  Other books  by Anne Rivers Siddons are much, much better.",Couldn't get through it,1.0,0
8,34297,"I was really looking forward to this book, I pre-ordered it all the way back in May, but it was really not on par with the other two.  Like other reviewers have said, the dual POV was poorly done.  I couldn't tell which character was speaking and about halfway through I decided I didn't care anymore.  The revelation about what the divergent actually are was kind of a let down.  The factions being a form of behavior modification was not explained well and didn't make sense to me.  It was a weak explanation of how the world of factions that existed in the first two books could come to be.  And most of all I don't think killing Tris was necessary or a good idea.  I think the situation in reverse would have been better.  The plan being for Tris to go in and set off the memory serum becuase she had a chance of survival and then at the last minute Caleb stepping in and sacrificing himself.  We already knew Tris would sacrifice herself for others, she did it several times in the previous books.  It also might have shown that the GDs weren't so damaged after all.The book was bad enough and the ending shocking enough that I actually wondered if the author did it on purpose.  A lot of people are saying that they won't go watch the movie now, and I'm wondering if that was the point.",Bad...just bad,1.0,0
9,21314,"Joe first I would like to say u are very brave.  So many times I thought as I read please let your torture be over.  Bravery doesn't even describe how I felt u made it through everything.  I always think about those who hide and lash out for the wrong they've endured.  I am so sorry for you not getting support in the Times you needed.  My question is why didn't your dads sister or Marie ever follow up on checking on you.  It seems like they gave up to soon as well. Why?  To me I find myself telling my sibling's that family is everything to me, if we don't have it what are we here for?
