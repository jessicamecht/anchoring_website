Even during a stop at a stop light coming home from work, I would get in a few pages. I definitely plan on reading his other book in the very near future! Highly recommended to all my friends and family. Don't waste your time with cookie-cutter authors whose books are always at Walmart and Target, buy Craig's book today, you will not be disappointed!",Stop everything and read this book!,5.0,1

I haven't cried Thu  much since reading Mocking Jay or the last few books of Harry Potter. it's  not easy to make me cry but Veronica Roth has done it. Fantastic book!",Amazing,5.0,0
2,59894,"I have been baking for longer than I care to admit, but I thought I'd give this book a try. Recently I made the hamantaschen, and as I was mixing the dough, I kept thinking that the proportions of ingredients in the recipe was wrong. Generally I try a recipe as written the first time around, though, and then decide whether to keep, tweak, or toss. This one falls into the last category. The dough was so short it was almost impossible to work with. Also, the recipe calls for using a 2 1/2 to 3"" cutter, but the number of pastries is based on a 2"" cutter. With a three inch cutter, the cookies came out teeny by the time they were shaped into traditional hamantaschen. They don't spread at all, so I wound up with cocktail sized pastries. They taste OK, but nothing special and although the apricot filling was good, it's kind of a no-brainer. Guess this one will go into the library book sale donation bin!",were these recipes tested?,1.0,0
3,1296,"I gave three descriptions in my title, that say it all, but the first two speak the loudest - this book is repetitive and boring.  The train rolls in, the train rolls out; in the old folk's facility Jacob is nothing but cranky and rude over and over again.  I truly don't understand how this book was picked up for publication.  I can more easily understand that it was made into a movie (even though I haven't seen it and after reading the book I probably won't), as I can imagine it is truly a spectacle with all of the color and magic of a circus.  And I will agree with other reviewers that it is well researched and the author does a good job portraying the post-depression times.  But that alone just doesn't carry the rest of the storyline, which is shallow and trite.  Among so many unaddressed issues - how is it that Jacob, an ivy league-educated young man, never looks back at what his life might have been after joining the low-lifes (mostly hobos, plus the entertainers) the circus attracts?  Certainly it's not to care for the animals, as you see him doing very little of that in the book.  At the end he wants to ""run away"" from the old folk's home and return to the only life he'd ever known - no surprise there - but it's a ridiculous proposition due to his age and I can't imagine anyone in the circus inviting him.  If you get nothing else from Uncle Al's character it is that he or any man in his position would be ruthless and cut loose anyone who didn't pull their weight, so what would a 90+ year old man do?  Certainly not water the elephants.",Repetitive and Boring but Well Researched,1.0,0
4,14142,"I bought this book because of the wonderful reviews and publicity it received.  YIKES!!!  Was I disappointed!  If Chabon had submitted any part of this book as a freshman English paper, he would have received an ""F"" for his diction.  The story was interesting and I did finish it, but the language was forced and jerky in its tempo.  It is a strange time to be a Jew ...or not...",A strange time indeed...,1.0,0
5,58305,"How can anyone NOT give this book 5 stars?  I appreciated the foreword, preface, afterword, explanatory notes &amp; the notes about the author by Matthew J. Bruccoli which enlightened my eyes before I started on the path of reading The Great Gatsby.It's funny that somehow my high school English teacher skipped this as required reading for me in the mid to late seventies.  I bought the book for my niece, Ashley, a few years ago.  I remembered a co-worker, Kim, who was an avid reader who once told me that The Great Gatsby was her all-time favorite book.  I was curious.  It's strang that it took my 17 year old niece to 'get me on the bandwagon' to finally read this classic book at age forty-one.  It amazes me to realize that the author, F. Scott Fitzgerald, died at age forty-four in Southern California on December 21, 1940, believing himself a failure.It's quite clear that Fitzgerald's ideas may have been 'made up' but he sued real life people, his own experiences and other true events to make his story.In retrosprect, the novel contains a story of money, greed, love, deceit, suspense, hate, alcoholism, stress, passion, time, ambition, death, life, status, 'leaving a mark in life', pleasure, vacation, free time, heroes, lies, trust, women vs. men, the 1920s, mystery, intrigue, romance, poor vs. rich, Sundays in the park, art, happiness, choices, fashion, lust, loneliness, friendship, adventure, honesty, making conversation, scenic views, people, music, dance, avoidance, communication, observation, summer, intelligence, panic, forgetting, agin, laughter, family values, prejudice, jealousy, past, future, youth, tranquility, grief, responsibility, self-improvement, self-actualization, carelessness, escaping and living life.",The 'Has It All' American Classic Novel,5.0,1
6,14170,"I have long been a fan of Michael Chabon's work.  ""Kavalier and Klay"" is one of my favorite contemporary novels.  I also loved the idea for ""Yiddish Policeman's Union"", a temporary Jewish homeland in Alaska.  Sadly, after I finished the last page I was very disappointed and wondered if he struggled mightily and rushed the novel out to print.  I think it's a third draft of a novel that he needed another draft or two to make it work.The best thing about the book is the way he fleshes out Sitka with the politics, economics, language and culture.  I was able to believe this place could exist.  The worst thing about the book is his main character, Landsman who I didn't find compelling, believable, or likeable.  Add to that is the problem of an inconsistent voice and occasionally confusing point of view.  One of the keys to detective fiction is voice and point of view.  If those aren't strong, then no matter how well you describe the backdrop to the story, it  loses credibility because reader doesn't commit to the character who acts as a guide to that world.The only character that came across as palpably real was the murdered victim who re-emerges later in an awkward flash back.  In only a few paragraphs, he comes across as a character I could follow through this book and who could bring it to life.Despite my disappointment, I'm glad that Chabon risks failure, stretches beyond his talent because that will only make him a better writer.  He hasn't written his masterpiece.  I'm sure that's yet to come.",A Courageous Misfire,2.0,0
7,33470,"Honestly, this is entirely due to the ending. I put up with some slow parts of the book, that's expected, but the way the books ends makes literally no sense. There were so many options, and it was like the author was hell bent on choosing one thing, when she had a plethora of choices.",Not Necessary,1.0,0
8,8293,"Since I only read 50 pages, I'm not sure that it is fair for me to review, but I have read some very long books and enjoyed them.  This book is NOWHERE after 50 pages, and it was painful to even get that far.  Each character is described in excruciating detail - not by actions, but simply by words and their own thoughts.  This really helped me to appreciate authors like Terry Brooks and Terry Goodkind who can describe characters as the story grows, so that something is happening as you read.  After all, it is our actions that define us...",Ssssllllloooowwww starting,2.0,0
9,1025,I have no idea what the hoopla is about but I find this book to be just alright at best. It is a little slow. The characters didnt have any passion or oomph. It was just very blah to me. I do like Reese Witherspoon and Rob so maybe the movie will be more entertaining.,It was just alright,2.0,0
