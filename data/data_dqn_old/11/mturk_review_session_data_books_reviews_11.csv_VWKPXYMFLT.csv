0,15200,"A great read! This true story of an amazing horse reads like excellent fiction. It covers a fascinating aspect of US history as it traces Seabiscuit's future owner, trainer and jockey from the early 1900's through the depression. The prose is rich and clear; the races are exciting; the horse has a big heart and a personality you'll never forget. Don't miss this one. And never fear, you do not need to be a horse racing fan to love this book.",Terrific book,5.0,1
1,6158,Have tried several of the recipes - always good.  Have gifted the book twice with a waffle maker and a couple of utensils - great shower gift.  Biggest reason for me to own it - display it front and center of my cookbook collection.  It is attractive and very small - a great addition with fabulous pictures to accompany delicious recipes.,Great recipes and attractive to display.,5.0,0
2,53948,"""Mr. Paradise"" has its moments, like when the Top Ten Dumb Criminals list comes up, or when Kelly, the beautiful model, sees through Frank the homicide detective immediately, or when Frank tries to concentrate on the crimes he's investigating rather than on Kelly's beautiful body.And then, of course, is the whole idea of the ""almost"" twins play-acting as topless cheerleaders for Mr. Paradise. Or the flip of the coin by Paradise to see who gets which one. (Some TV show loves to depict women jumping on trampolines. Same appeal.)Leonard aficionados will expect the worst, and they'd be right. One chopped up body, cut in six parts by a chain saw. One bungled stock transaction. Three criminals, three shots at a ""business"" meeting. Enough blood and bungling for even the choosiest of Leonard critics. Good job, Elmore.Larry Rochelle, Author of the Palmer Morel Mystery Series"" BLUE ICE, CRACKED CRYSTALS, GULF GHOST, DEATH AND DEVOTION, BOURBON AND BLISS, TRACETRACKS.",Top Ten Stupid Criminals,5.0,1
3,24718,"A difficult, but important, story that needs to be told. This is the biography of Louis Zamperini, Olympic runner and American hero. Some of this is so horrific that I found myself having to put it aside and take a breather, but it has a great finish. Do continue to the very end. The title says it all: A Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption. Every American should read this book.",Amazing and Important,5.0,0
4,10500,"I know Mr. Sheldon has written a gazillion books, and I am certain that I once read one by him that I really liked, but I cannot remember which one, and it is MOST DEFINITELY not this one. This book is boring, slow-paced, and dull. Dana Evans, for one, starts out as a least likely mom type, which is how she is dropped into the plot, and true to form, turns out to be an awful Mom. Right away I didn't like her because of this and couldn't feel for her. She runs around the globe leaving her &quot;son&quot; with a lady she just met, but she does call once in awhile. Dana Evans' next sin is to tolerate the unheard of relationship between her fiance, Jeff, and his ex-wife, who just happens to be a perfect ten in every way. Dana questions in her mind, to her credit, but she sure is a whole lot more patient than any American woman I know. As Dana chases a murder story that winds up getting top government officials to tell her things that they have never told anyone (and this while she is a Star Reporter!), her son is first a troublemaker and then neglected at home. Nonetheless, our heroine plunges forth, reveals all, and there is a nice, homey, happy ending that - well, that left me nauseated. Don't waste your time on this one, I imagine Sidney Sheldon fans are pretty disappointed, because I would hate to think this is a sample of his work.",Lousy.,1.0,0
5,35405,"I was on board for the entire series. I didn't care for the small chapters jumping back and forth, it made a disconnect between the characters for me. The sudden, and I mean sudden, demise of a strong female character ( don't want to say any names) doesn't make her any stronger by her self sacrifice. I happened just about the time you figured out what was going on.Usually I'll reread a book several times, as I have all of the other books in the series. Not this one. I was shocked, disappointed and unsatisfied with the entire book and think it could have gone in a much different direction and could even have been a follow up story. A huge reader who is faithful to characters. Hate seeing Four left out in the cold all over again.Ironically, this is the very first negative review I have ever written.",unhappy,1.0,0
6,16959,"I have only discovered Val McDermid in the past few months, and have been reading her Tony Hill/Carol Jordan books in order. I have just finished The Torment of Others and find myself increasingly impressed by her skill in plotting and characterization. Early in this book, McDermid throws us a red herring, that was clear. But she does a very good job of concealing the true villain, which I finally figured out just before it was revealed. Even then, things get very dicey, and a last minute discovery brings it all together.This is a story of power, sadism, perversion and brutal murder. McDermid pulls no punches and is not averse to killing off regular characters. It is not a cozy mystery, but readers familiar with the British TV series already know that. On one level, it is a slow unfolding of a relationship between two damaged people: Hill and Jordan. On another level, it is a brilliant and (as far as I know) grittily realistic police procedural; and on yet a third level, it is about the quest for justice and fairness in a world where the lines between good and evil have grown a bit blurred.I reserve five stars for truly exceptional books, and would award 4.5 if I could. Thanks, Ms. McDermid, for another complicated and suspenseful reading experience. I now move on to the next in the series.",So cleverly plotted...,4.0,0
7,1296,"I gave three descriptions in my title, that say it all, but the first two speak the loudest - this book is repetitive and boring.  The train rolls in, the train rolls out; in the old folk's facility Jacob is nothing but cranky and rude over and over again.  I truly don't understand how this book was picked up for publication.  I can more easily understand that it was made into a movie (even though I haven't seen it and after reading the book I probably won't), as I can imagine it is truly a spectacle with all of the color and magic of a circus.  And I will agree with other reviewers that it is well researched and the author does a good job portraying the post-depression times.  But that alone just doesn't carry the rest of the storyline, which is shallow and trite.  Among so many unaddressed issues - how is it that Jacob, an ivy league-educated young man, never looks back at what his life might have been after joining the low-lifes (mostly hobos, plus the entertainers) the circus attracts?  Certainly it's not to care for the animals, as you see him doing very little of that in the book.  At the end he wants to ""run away"" from the old folk's home and return to the only life he'd ever known - no surprise there - but it's a ridiculous proposition due to his age and I can't imagine anyone in the circus inviting him.  If you get nothing else from Uncle Al's character it is that he or any man in his position would be ruthless and cut loose anyone who didn't pull their weight, so what would a 90+ year old man do?  Certainly not water the elephants.",Repetitive and Boring but Well Researched,1.0,0
8,6946,"This book does have some worthy insights, however the author tends to pigeonhole people into oversimplified categories according to the ""games"" they play to get their needs met.  In real life however, I think people are more likely to fall into various roles, or games, at different times in their lives. Something about the presentation seemed just a little pretentious, too. The author sometimes appeared to think he was giving away some secret bits of information, heretofore known only by him or a few select others.  This left a bad taste in my mouth.  Nonetheless, some of the information presented was very valid, and at the very least the book serves as an excellent reminder that we are all afraid of rejection, no matter who we are.  But we are not all ""losers"", in spite of the games we play; I don't think the author gives enough emphasis to this fact.  In addition, I think that sometimes life is just what it is, and looking at it like it is some kind of game is of no useful value whatsoever.  Watch out if you think you are having some kind of ""aha!"" experience, as it will be short-lived.",Worth giving a look,3.0,0
9,31049,"***NOTE: MILD SPOILERS***I was excited to finally sit down and read this book after enjoying the first int he series when it came out a while back. I expected a fun adventure continuing the feeling of the first book, and I was seriously disappointed.First off, the beginning is very jarring. The book continues right off of where the first one ended, and it can be very difficult for a reader to remember all the little details and connections with characters that I last saw nearly a year ago. That aside however...Throughout the entire book the characters were incredibly erratic bordering on bipolar. With little to no motivation they would be either paralyzed with fear one minute and the next throwing chairs off of rooftops or just walking 10+ miles to the HQ of the bad guys because one person died (after hundreds/thousands were killed in cold blood, NOPE must stop these few people from dieing.)The most glaring example of this comes from the &#34;evil&#34; leader herself. After enslaving an entire faction to her mind control, killing countless more, and threatening to kill everyone left just to get ahold of a strong Divergent, she tries TWICE, then suddenly gives up and attempts to execute Tris instead of continuing with her research. This makes NO sense at all.This was nothing and nowhere near what Divergence had the potential to be. This is mindless fluff from an author who is unsure of where the series is going to go, and is reluctant to force the characters into any one situation or motivation. This is just chaos start to finish.Hopefully others learn from this author's mistakes. I won't be reading the next novel in this series.",Incredibly disappointing.,1.0,0
