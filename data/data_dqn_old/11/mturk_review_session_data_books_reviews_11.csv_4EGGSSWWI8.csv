2,6946,"This book does have some worthy insights, however the author tends to pigeonhole people into oversimplified categories according to the ""games"" they play to get their needs met.  In real life however, I think people are more likely to fall into various roles, or games, at different times in their lives. Something about the presentation seemed just a little pretentious, too. The author sometimes appeared to think he was giving away some secret bits of information, heretofore known only by him or a few select others.  This left a bad taste in my mouth.  Nonetheless, some of the information presented was very valid, and at the very least the book serves as an excellent reminder that we are all afraid of rejection, no matter who we are.  But we are not all ""losers"", in spite of the games we play; I don't think the author gives enough emphasis to this fact.  In addition, I think that sometimes life is just what it is, and looking at it like it is some kind of game is of no useful value whatsoever.  Watch out if you think you are having some kind of ""aha!"" experience, as it will be short-lived.",Worth giving a look,3.0,1
3,52416,"I'm a big fan of Lawhead's &quot;The Iron Lance&quot; and his &quot;Song of Albion&quot; series.  With high hopes, I purchased this historical novel.  My knowledge of St. Patrick is limited, and I looked forward to discovering more of his life and his spiritual influence in Ireland.&quot;Patrick: Son of Ireland&quot; does many things well.  The settings are believable and well-researched, the language fluid, and the dry details turned into fascinating tidbits.  I particularly enjoyed the Roman battle scenes and descriptions of the Plague.  Sobering stuff.  Succat, later known as Patrick, is a character with flaws and foibles, a man who grows slowly into the understanding of his calling.  And when Succat comes to a final point of humility and turning, Lawhead paints a succint and touching scene.  He employs Pelagius, who plays a minimal part in only the final thirty pages of the book, to address Succat: &quot;You have learned what a man can do in his own strength...Perhaps now it is time to learn what God can do with a man who knows the limits of his strength.&quot;Unfortunately, the book never allows us to see the result of this turning.  We witness years of futility in Succat's life, and, in fact, we ourselves grow weary of his attempts to escape slavery and of the deceits he thrusts upon even those he claims to love.  I appreciate that all this brings Succat to a medieval mid-life crisis, but I would've enjoyed seeing the working out of his newfound knowledge.  I even started to suspect that Lawhead would be throwing a sequel our way.  Instead, he throws us a bone--a prologue and epilogue that tidily skim over Patrick's years of hard spiritual work.I trod my way along the arduous trails of Succat's life, found some wisdom to be gained and some eventual rewards, but felt cheated by the blithe conclusion.  Am I missing a sequel, or is this all we get?",3 1/2 Stars...Am I Missing a Sequel?,3.0,1

5,3528,There aren't many public school novels being written and read these days. Rowling's Potter series is an exception (and in my opinion they are not all that good). However if you are old enough to have read Tom Brown's Schooldays then the Flaashman series may be of interest. If you have enjoyed Kipling's Indian stories then Flashman is also worth a try.,For kiplomaniacs,5.0,1

7,27722,"I was very interested to read Zuckoff's ""Lost in Shangri-La.""  I'm a sucker for non-fiction accounts about people doing things or surviving experiences that are foreign to me.  For this reason, I picked up this book with a great deal of excitement.  I was sorely disappointed.I was looking forward to reading about how a group of plane crash survivors braved through a foreign jungle, fighting animals and cannibals, to eventually make their way back to civilization.  The reviews and book jacket made it read like a thrilling adventure in the heart of the jungle, with lots of action and suspense.  What I got was something much different.Spoiler alert!  Do not read on if you don't want some of the book spoiled for you!The survivors don't have to trek that far before they make it to a clearing. They basically stay there until they are rescued.  The natives are not restless, nor all that cannibalistic.  Basically, they are simple, kind people who take an interest in helping the survivors.  They are eventually rescued by a daring glider-related escape.  This was one of the only truly entertaining parts of the book for me.TThere was also too much background information on people that didn't need to be told.  We didn't need to know all the background info (birthplace, former jobs, marital status, etc.) on the press corps that covered the story, or other characters that weren't survivors.  I ended up skipping through much of it to get to the end.If you are really into true-life adventure stories, I highly recommend that you check out Jon Krakauer's booksInto Thin Air (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)andInto the Wild.  They are gripping, tightly told, and exhilarating reads.  Another interesting read isThe Lost City of Z: A Tale of Deadly Obsession in the Amazon, about a man who journeys into the Amazon.  I recommend these much more than Zuckoff's book.","Not enough of a gripping, compelling story",2.0,0
8,8477,"I have read many of Lisa's books, and have enjoyed them.  But, this one comes across as so contrived --- too many things just fall into place -- and everything is wrapped up much too quickly at the end.  It seems impossible to me that there would be enough organ donors in the city of Philadelphia to sway an election.  Marta is beaten up within an inch of her life, and still jumps in the car and drives to the Jersey Shore --------- very implausible.  And, the ending seems thrown together in an attempt to sweep up all the debris.",Too contrived,2.0,0
9,17647,"Frank McCourt is a wonderfull story teller.I can almost hear that Irish accent as i read this book!  Very touching,funny,sad,many emotions felt while reading this book.Yes,Frank had a depressing childhood but he shares  it with us in a very colourful way.There's no doubt that the poverty he  lived in was appaling but this book is not just a story where another Irish  child grows up in a slum and goes nowhere.He shares his dreams,his  thoughts,his longing to be someone and go somewhere.  He tells this story  in such a delightful way that you can't help reading on.For those of you  who cannot hear an Irish speaking voice in your head I recommend you listen  to this on the cassette that is available.This book is very moving and very  well written.If you liked this book then please read the follow on called  'Tis.",Very touching,4.0,1
