Even during a stop at a stop light coming home from work, I would get in a few pages. I definitely plan on reading his other book in the very near future! Highly recommended to all my friends and family. Don't waste your time with cookie-cutter authors whose books are always at Walmart and Target, buy Craig's book today, you will not be disappointed!",Stop everything and read this book!,5.0,1
1,37080,"A Game Of thrones was a fantastic book. While I didn't like A Clash Of Kings, it was still an okay book. A Storm Of Swords is one of the best fantasy books ever written. So what happened? GRRM is a good writer. He may make mistakes, and he may over describe things at times, but he's a good writer nonetheless. ................ So why does this book (And the fifth book) SUCK? I don't know. But It's awful. I don't really know what I can say that hasn't been said, so I'm just going to finish the review now.",The downfall of the series,1.0,0
2,59894,"I have been baking for longer than I care to admit, but I thought I'd give this book a try. Recently I made the hamantaschen, and as I was mixing the dough, I kept thinking that the proportions of ingredients in the recipe was wrong. Generally I try a recipe as written the first time around, though, and then decide whether to keep, tweak, or toss. This one falls into the last category. The dough was so short it was almost impossible to work with. Also, the recipe calls for using a 2 1/2 to 3"" cutter, but the number of pastries is based on a 2"" cutter. With a three inch cutter, the cookies came out teeny by the time they were shaped into traditional hamantaschen. They don't spread at all, so I wound up with cocktail sized pastries. They taste OK, but nothing special and although the apricot filling was good, it's kind of a no-brainer. Guess this one will go into the library book sale donation bin!",were these recipes tested?,1.0,0
3,24718,"A difficult, but important, story that needs to be told. This is the biography of Louis Zamperini, Olympic runner and American hero. Some of this is so horrific that I found myself having to put it aside and take a breather, but it has a great finish. Do continue to the very end. The title says it all: A Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption. Every American should read this book.",Amazing and Important,5.0,1

5,35405,"I was on board for the entire series. I didn't care for the small chapters jumping back and forth, it made a disconnect between the characters for me. The sudden, and I mean sudden, demise of a strong female character ( don't want to say any names) doesn't make her any stronger by her self sacrifice. I happened just about the time you figured out what was going on.Usually I'll reread a book several times, as I have all of the other books in the series. Not this one. I was shocked, disappointed and unsatisfied with the entire book and think it could have gone in a much different direction and could even have been a follow up story. A huge reader who is faithful to characters. Hate seeing Four left out in the cold all over again.Ironically, this is the very first negative review I have ever written.",unhappy,1.0,0
6,8477,"I have read many of Lisa's books, and have enjoyed them.  But, this one comes across as so contrived --- too many things just fall into place -- and everything is wrapped up much too quickly at the end.  It seems impossible to me that there would be enough organ donors in the city of Philadelphia to sway an election.  Marta is beaten up within an inch of her life, and still jumps in the car and drives to the Jersey Shore --------- very implausible.  And, the ending seems thrown together in an attempt to sweep up all the debris.",Too contrived,2.0,0
7,33470,"Honestly, this is entirely due to the ending. I put up with some slow parts of the book, that's expected, but the way the books ends makes literally no sense. There were so many options, and it was like the author was hell bent on choosing one thing, when she had a plethora of choices.",Not Necessary,1.0,0
8,51405,"Having read very few fantasy novels, I am not a proclaimed expert.  All I know is that I was soooo intrigued by this novel.  The dark underworld of the London subway made for a fas- cinating setting.  I loved each  character:  Richard Mayhew, Door, the Marquis de Carabas, Mr. Croup and Mr.  Vandemar.  The good ones were so good they made me ache, the bad ones were  so evil they made me shudder.  And then there were the ones you were never  sure of.  I cannot recall a book in which every scene was so vivid in my  imagination.  I have since bought everything I have been able to find by  Gaiman. Just finished Stardust, a wonderful tale of two worlds.  Looking  forward to Smoke and Mirrors and the Sandman collection.",My favorite book of l998,5.0,0
9,1025,I have no idea what the hoopla is about but I find this book to be just alright at best. It is a little slow. The characters didnt have any passion or oomph. It was just very blah to me. I do like Reese Witherspoon and Rob so maybe the movie will be more entertaining.,It was just alright,2.0,0
