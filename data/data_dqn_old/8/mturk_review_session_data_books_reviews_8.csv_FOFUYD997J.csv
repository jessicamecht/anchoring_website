What fun it was being inside this book and living out the adventures and missteps along the way!  A fun summer read, 4 stars!","movie, please!!!!",4.0,0
2,12993,"This book is on the shelf withRadical Son: A Generational Odysseyand""I Heard You Paint Houses"": Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran and the Inside Story of the Mafia, the Teamsters, and the Last Ride of Jimmy Hoffa. This is a great memoir that illuminates both the man and his times. Regarding the man, if one would read Frasers,Quartered Safe Out Here: A Recollection of the War in Burma, IMHO one of the great war memoirs,and see the suffering, the privation, death and destruction related there; well, it might give some insight to the personality, the nature of the man many reviewers here find off putting and embarrassing. I guess when you run across an open field to take a Japanese position and you see friends fall dead around you, it may affect you. How then to deal with that? One way I feel is to come to believe (if you didn't earlier), that this suffering and loss must be for something big! Something worth fighting for.Perhaps England?As regards the times, as the years pass and one watches the country and way of life you fought for and your friends died for, spin down the drain like so much dirty water, well maybe if you had a set of balls you'ld be irate. Fraser sure was and from the outside looking in it appears he had good reason. The book is divided into three main themes, Angry Old Man (my favorite), guess what that's about? Interlude (second favorite), it's a kind of AOM lite, and Shooting Scripts, about his Hollywood days. This is a great memoir by an Angry Old Man. Deal with it!And if anyone from ESPN/Santana Sports sees this, how 'bout covering the SignPost race?",Man Lit For......errrr....Men,5.0,0
3,27722,"I was very interested to read Zuckoff's ""Lost in Shangri-La.""  I'm a sucker for non-fiction accounts about people doing things or surviving experiences that are foreign to me.  For this reason, I picked up this book with a great deal of excitement.  I was sorely disappointed.I was looking forward to reading about how a group of plane crash survivors braved through a foreign jungle, fighting animals and cannibals, to eventually make their way back to civilization.  The reviews and book jacket made it read like a thrilling adventure in the heart of the jungle, with lots of action and suspense.  What I got was something much different.Spoiler alert!  Do not read on if you don't want some of the book spoiled for you!The survivors don't have to trek that far before they make it to a clearing. They basically stay there until they are rescued.  The natives are not restless, nor all that cannibalistic.  Basically, they are simple, kind people who take an interest in helping the survivors.  They are eventually rescued by a daring glider-related escape.  This was one of the only truly entertaining parts of the book for me.TThere was also too much background information on people that didn't need to be told.  We didn't need to know all the background info (birthplace, former jobs, marital status, etc.) on the press corps that covered the story, or other characters that weren't survivors.  I ended up skipping through much of it to get to the end.If you are really into true-life adventure stories, I highly recommend that you check out Jon Krakauer's booksInto Thin Air (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)andInto the Wild.  They are gripping, tightly told, and exhilarating reads.  Another interesting read isThe Lost City of Z: A Tale of Deadly Obsession in the Amazon, about a man who journeys into the Amazon.  I recommend these much more than Zuckoff's book.","Not enough of a gripping, compelling story",2.0,0
4,33133,"In this round, Four transforms into a fourteen year old girl with a princess poster on his wall, Tris continues to have every awesome trait pounded away from her person, and hundreds of pages are dedicated to the same brain numbing sermon, bad science, and destruction of the word genetics. We get it. She's totally into sacrifice, and if someone isn't loudly martyred at the end, the book will only be 30% waterlogged with Christian propaganda.I saw the end of Season Five of Buffy. That was a pretty good hero-death sacrifice that broke my heart and blew my mind. I read the Game of the Thrones series. That was a great one with multiple first person narrators and incredible human sacrifice, building towards some ultimate greater good. Both of these series still have my heart. People are not angry because of the events of the ending; they are angry because the ending was pointless, the book is poorly written, and much of the big reveals are utter nonsense. This was just a mess from a writer perhaps pushed too hard by her publisher to finish something quickly, and as a result took every easy exit away from her loyal fans.",George RR Martin makes a better George RR Martin,1.0,0
5,37080,"A Game Of thrones was a fantastic book. While I didn't like A Clash Of Kings, it was still an okay book. A Storm Of Swords is one of the best fantasy books ever written. So what happened? GRRM is a good writer. He may make mistakes, and he may over describe things at times, but he's a good writer nonetheless. ................ So why does this book (And the fifth book) SUCK? I don't know. But It's awful. I don't really know what I can say that hasn't been said, so I'm just going to finish the review now.",The downfall of the series,1.0,1
6,10500,"I know Mr. Sheldon has written a gazillion books, and I am certain that I once read one by him that I really liked, but I cannot remember which one, and it is MOST DEFINITELY not this one. This book is boring, slow-paced, and dull. Dana Evans, for one, starts out as a least likely mom type, which is how she is dropped into the plot, and true to form, turns out to be an awful Mom. Right away I didn't like her because of this and couldn't feel for her. She runs around the globe leaving her &quot;son&quot; with a lady she just met, but she does call once in awhile. Dana Evans' next sin is to tolerate the unheard of relationship between her fiance, Jeff, and his ex-wife, who just happens to be a perfect ten in every way. Dana questions in her mind, to her credit, but she sure is a whole lot more patient than any American woman I know. As Dana chases a murder story that winds up getting top government officials to tell her things that they have never told anyone (and this while she is a Star Reporter!), her son is first a troublemaker and then neglected at home. Nonetheless, our heroine plunges forth, reveals all, and there is a nice, homey, happy ending that - well, that left me nauseated. Don't waste your time on this one, I imagine Sidney Sheldon fans are pretty disappointed, because I would hate to think this is a sample of his work.",Lousy.,1.0,0
7,14170,"I have long been a fan of Michael Chabon's work.  ""Kavalier and Klay"" is one of my favorite contemporary novels.  I also loved the idea for ""Yiddish Policeman's Union"", a temporary Jewish homeland in Alaska.  Sadly, after I finished the last page I was very disappointed and wondered if he struggled mightily and rushed the novel out to print.  I think it's a third draft of a novel that he needed another draft or two to make it work.The best thing about the book is the way he fleshes out Sitka with the politics, economics, language and culture.  I was able to believe this place could exist.  The worst thing about the book is his main character, Landsman who I didn't find compelling, believable, or likeable.  Add to that is the problem of an inconsistent voice and occasionally confusing point of view.  One of the keys to detective fiction is voice and point of view.  If those aren't strong, then no matter how well you describe the backdrop to the story, it  loses credibility because reader doesn't commit to the character who acts as a guide to that world.The only character that came across as palpably real was the murdered victim who re-emerges later in an awkward flash back.  In only a few paragraphs, he comes across as a character I could follow through this book and who could bring it to life.Despite my disappointment, I'm glad that Chabon risks failure, stretches beyond his talent because that will only make him a better writer.  He hasn't written his masterpiece.  I'm sure that's yet to come.",A Courageous Misfire,2.0,0
