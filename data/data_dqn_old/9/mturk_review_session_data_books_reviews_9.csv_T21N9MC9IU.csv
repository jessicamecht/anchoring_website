1,52416,"I'm a big fan of Lawhead's &quot;The Iron Lance&quot; and his &quot;Song of Albion&quot; series.  With high hopes, I purchased this historical novel.  My knowledge of St. Patrick is limited, and I looked forward to discovering more of his life and his spiritual influence in Ireland.&quot;Patrick: Son of Ireland&quot; does many things well.  The settings are believable and well-researched, the language fluid, and the dry details turned into fascinating tidbits.  I particularly enjoyed the Roman battle scenes and descriptions of the Plague.  Sobering stuff.  Succat, later known as Patrick, is a character with flaws and foibles, a man who grows slowly into the understanding of his calling.  And when Succat comes to a final point of humility and turning, Lawhead paints a succint and touching scene.  He employs Pelagius, who plays a minimal part in only the final thirty pages of the book, to address Succat: &quot;You have learned what a man can do in his own strength...Perhaps now it is time to learn what God can do with a man who knows the limits of his strength.&quot;Unfortunately, the book never allows us to see the result of this turning.  We witness years of futility in Succat's life, and, in fact, we ourselves grow weary of his attempts to escape slavery and of the deceits he thrusts upon even those he claims to love.  I appreciate that all this brings Succat to a medieval mid-life crisis, but I would've enjoyed seeing the working out of his newfound knowledge.  I even started to suspect that Lawhead would be throwing a sequel our way.  Instead, he throws us a bone--a prologue and epilogue that tidily skim over Patrick's years of hard spiritual work.I trod my way along the arduous trails of Succat's life, found some wisdom to be gained and some eventual rewards, but felt cheated by the blithe conclusion.  Am I missing a sequel, or is this all we get?",3 1/2 Stars...Am I Missing a Sequel?,3.0,1

3,12993,"This book is on the shelf withRadical Son: A Generational Odysseyand""I Heard You Paint Houses"": Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran and the Inside Story of the Mafia, the Teamsters, and the Last Ride of Jimmy Hoffa. This is a great memoir that illuminates both the man and his times. Regarding the man, if one would read Frasers,Quartered Safe Out Here: A Recollection of the War in Burma, IMHO one of the great war memoirs,and see the suffering, the privation, death and destruction related there; well, it might give some insight to the personality, the nature of the man many reviewers here find off putting and embarrassing. I guess when you run across an open field to take a Japanese position and you see friends fall dead around you, it may affect you. How then to deal with that? One way I feel is to come to believe (if you didn't earlier), that this suffering and loss must be for something big! Something worth fighting for.Perhaps England?As regards the times, as the years pass and one watches the country and way of life you fought for and your friends died for, spin down the drain like so much dirty water, well maybe if you had a set of balls you'ld be irate. Fraser sure was and from the outside looking in it appears he had good reason. The book is divided into three main themes, Angry Old Man (my favorite), guess what that's about? Interlude (second favorite), it's a kind of AOM lite, and Shooting Scripts, about his Hollywood days. This is a great memoir by an Angry Old Man. Deal with it!And if anyone from ESPN/Santana Sports sees this, how 'bout covering the SignPost race?",Man Lit For......errrr....Men,5.0,1

5,1296,"I gave three descriptions in my title, that say it all, but the first two speak the loudest - this book is repetitive and boring.  The train rolls in, the train rolls out; in the old folk's facility Jacob is nothing but cranky and rude over and over again.  I truly don't understand how this book was picked up for publication.  I can more easily understand that it was made into a movie (even though I haven't seen it and after reading the book I probably won't), as I can imagine it is truly a spectacle with all of the color and magic of a circus.  And I will agree with other reviewers that it is well researched and the author does a good job portraying the post-depression times.  But that alone just doesn't carry the rest of the storyline, which is shallow and trite.  Among so many unaddressed issues - how is it that Jacob, an ivy league-educated young man, never looks back at what his life might have been after joining the low-lifes (mostly hobos, plus the entertainers) the circus attracts?  Certainly it's not to care for the animals, as you see him doing very little of that in the book.  At the end he wants to ""run away"" from the old folk's home and return to the only life he'd ever known - no surprise there - but it's a ridiculous proposition due to his age and I can't imagine anyone in the circus inviting him.  If you get nothing else from Uncle Al's character it is that he or any man in his position would be ruthless and cut loose anyone who didn't pull their weight, so what would a 90+ year old man do?  Certainly not water the elephants.",Repetitive and Boring but Well Researched,1.0,0
6,61873,"I'm afraid I could not get through this book.  I read the prologue and  first two chapters and put it down.  I rarely do that with a book.  It  wasn't making much sense to me.  It was somewhat of a downer and I like to  be entertained when I read.  Also I just don't like four letter words.  I  don't think authors have to use that language in their books.  Other books  by Anne Rivers Siddons are much, much better.",Couldn't get through it,1.0,0
7,8293,"Since I only read 50 pages, I'm not sure that it is fair for me to review, but I have read some very long books and enjoyed them.  This book is NOWHERE after 50 pages, and it was painful to even get that far.  Each character is described in excruciating detail - not by actions, but simply by words and their own thoughts.  This really helped me to appreciate authors like Terry Brooks and Terry Goodkind who can describe characters as the story grows, so that something is happening as you read.  After all, it is our actions that define us...",Ssssllllloooowwww starting,2.0,0

9,14374,"What an embarrassing disaster for this author and publisher. Had they bothered to have the book read by anyone who knows anything about German history, they would have gotten some helpful comments. Gaines reduces the very real statebuilding accomplishments of the Hohenzollern family to a mixture of scurrilous gossip and prurient commentary. There are numerous mistakes in the part of the book that have to do with Protestant history (e.g., neither Ulrich Zwingli nor Thomas Muentzer were Anabaptists), when the author is not merely repeating nostalgic hearsay about its various events. He is totally ignorant of the social context of a number of the compositions he discusses (e.g., saying it that was daring of Bach to compose a piece with the title ""God is my kind"" for a civic occasion--actually, such pieces were customary and commissioned in order to heighten the civic consciousness of the burghers who sponsored them). After 150 pp. of nonsense and error, I was no longer sympathetic to his larger argument. Too bad the publisher didn't find a better manuscript on early modern German cultural history, since it is a fascinating topic. Unfortunately reading this book conveys no sense of its fascination. I'd give it zero if that were an option.",A mixture of error and scurrilous gossip,1.0,0
