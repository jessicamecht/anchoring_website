It covers a fascinating aspect of US history as it traces Seabiscuit's future owner, trainer and jockey from the early 1900's through the depression. The prose is rich and clear; the races are exciting; the horse has a big heart and a personality you'll never forget. Don't miss this one. And never fear, you do not need to be a horse racing fan to love this book.",Terrific book,5.0,1
1,12580,"In my line of work, I have to drive a lot from school to school with trips taking anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour and a half. These Nine Hours of adventure, hobbits, men, dwarves, elves and Tom Bombadil, (yes, Tom Bombadil!) is a great way to pass the time. Unlike the Unabridged Reading where the casual listener can get bogged down in the misings of the reader (a production which should be given justice in a situation where you can give it your full attention), this exciting performance with a great cast of voices and well done music is just what the traveling listener needs. Gandalf, Sam, Frodo and Aragorn's voices have to be my favorites. Gollum and Gimli are a bit overdone but to interesting effect but they are all leagues better than the BBC version. I bought that first figuring that a British version would be the golden standard but Gollum just sounded like a normal guy who occasionally slurped or sucked his words and Gandalf sounded like a real loser. The Gandalf here speaks with authority as does Aragorn. Sam has just the right touch of innocence and Frodo never lets the listener down. All the major events of the books with the exception of Galadriel being tempted by the Ring are very well presented. What a sight for sore eyes (or ears I should say) was it to hear Tom Bombadil's merry voice, a favorite of fans and readers who never quite made it into any production at all of the series. The battles are all satisfying as is the climax in Mount Doom and the skirmish with Shelob. I recommend it for journeys long and short.",The Best Audio Production I've Yet Heard,5.0,1
2,61873,"I'm afraid I could not get through this book.  I read the prologue and  first two chapters and put it down.  I rarely do that with a book.  It  wasn't making much sense to me.  It was somewhat of a downer and I like to  be entertained when I read.  Also I just don't like four letter words.  I  don't think authors have to use that language in their books.  Other books  by Anne Rivers Siddons are much, much better.",Couldn't get through it,1.0,0

4,58305,"How can anyone NOT give this book 5 stars?  I appreciated the foreword, preface, afterword, explanatory notes &amp; the notes about the author by Matthew J. Bruccoli which enlightened my eyes before I started on the path of reading The Great Gatsby.It's funny that somehow my high school English teacher skipped this as required reading for me in the mid to late seventies.  I bought the book for my niece, Ashley, a few years ago.  I remembered a co-worker, Kim, who was an avid reader who once told me that The Great Gatsby was her all-time favorite book.  I was curious.  It's strang that it took my 17 year old niece to 'get me on the bandwagon' to finally read this classic book at age forty-one.  It amazes me to realize that the author, F. Scott Fitzgerald, died at age forty-four in Southern California on December 21, 1940, believing himself a failure.It's quite clear that Fitzgerald's ideas may have been 'made up' but he sued real life people, his own experiences and other true events to make his story.In retrosprect, the novel contains a story of money, greed, love, deceit, suspense, hate, alcoholism, stress, passion, time, ambition, death, life, status, 'leaving a mark in life', pleasure, vacation, free time, heroes, lies, trust, women vs. men, the 1920s, mystery, intrigue, romance, poor vs. rich, Sundays in the park, art, happiness, choices, fashion, lust, loneliness, friendship, adventure, honesty, making conversation, scenic views, people, music, dance, avoidance, communication, observation, summer, intelligence, panic, forgetting, agin, laughter, family values, prejudice, jealousy, past, future, youth, tranquility, grief, responsibility, self-improvement, self-actualization, carelessness, escaping and living life.",The 'Has It All' American Classic Novel,5.0,1

7,16959,"I have only discovered Val McDermid in the past few months, and have been reading her Tony Hill/Carol Jordan books in order. I have just finished The Torment of Others and find myself increasingly impressed by her skill in plotting and characterization. Early in this book, McDermid throws us a red herring, that was clear. But she does a very good job of concealing the true villain, which I finally figured out just before it was revealed. Even then, things get very dicey, and a last minute discovery brings it all together.This is a story of power, sadism, perversion and brutal murder. McDermid pulls no punches and is not averse to killing off regular characters. It is not a cozy mystery, but readers familiar with the British TV series already know that. On one level, it is a slow unfolding of a relationship between two damaged people: Hill and Jordan. On another level, it is a brilliant and (as far as I know) grittily realistic police procedural; and on yet a third level, it is about the quest for justice and fairness in a world where the lines between good and evil have grown a bit blurred.I reserve five stars for truly exceptional books, and would award 4.5 if I could. Thanks, Ms. McDermid, for another complicated and suspenseful reading experience. I now move on to the next in the series.",So cleverly plotted...,4.0,1
8,31049,"***NOTE: MILD SPOILERS***I was excited to finally sit down and read this book after enjoying the first int he series when it came out a while back. I expected a fun adventure continuing the feeling of the first book, and I was seriously disappointed.First off, the beginning is very jarring. The book continues right off of where the first one ended, and it can be very difficult for a reader to remember all the little details and connections with characters that I last saw nearly a year ago. That aside however...Throughout the entire book the characters were incredibly erratic bordering on bipolar. With little to no motivation they would be either paralyzed with fear one minute and the next throwing chairs off of rooftops or just walking 10+ miles to the HQ of the bad guys because one person died (after hundreds/thousands were killed in cold blood, NOPE must stop these few people from dieing.)The most glaring example of this comes from the &#34;evil&#34; leader herself. After enslaving an entire faction to her mind control, killing countless more, and threatening to kill everyone left just to get ahold of a strong Divergent, she tries TWICE, then suddenly gives up and attempts to execute Tris instead of continuing with her research. This makes NO sense at all.This was nothing and nowhere near what Divergence had the potential to be. This is mindless fluff from an author who is unsure of where the series is going to go, and is reluctant to force the characters into any one situation or motivation. This is just chaos start to finish.Hopefully others learn from this author's mistakes. I won't be reading the next novel in this series.",Incredibly disappointing.,1.0,0
