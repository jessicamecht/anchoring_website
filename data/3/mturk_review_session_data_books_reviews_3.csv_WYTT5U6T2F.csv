0,Couldn't wait to put it down!,"I didn't get into the characters at all, I skipped the last 100 pages and read the last chapter.",0
1,VERY ENJOYABLE,This book was very good. I liked reading from both ages of the main character. The ending was more of a surprise since from the first page I thought it would end completely different!!!,0
2,An eye catching title with great depths.,"I never found a book that so accurately portrayed growing old and how you are treated. The story begins with life in the circus,",0
3,Walking through five miles of swamp has to be more fun.,"It was all I could do to muster the enthusiasm to read while engaged with this novel. Why? Very Technical. So much so it got into the way of the story. Disguised propaganda encased in a story? Yes. The idea of the story cloaked in this book kept me reading. If you must have the experience of pain reading this book, but do not want to read it, cut off a toe with a razor. You may feel the same after is all over.",0
4,too sad,"This book was for the most part far too sad. It was also so cruel firstlyto the people who were treated worse than, being starved, being murdered, having no human rights. The animal cruelty was unbearable and inhumane. I am so glad I didn't see the movie. I wish I had never read the book it was nightmarish. Although we know that these things happened its just awful to read it and feel such pain AND sorrow. I woulsnt recommend to to anybody, ever",1
5,Save Your Time and Money,"This novel is a rambling, disjointed and thoroughly annoying depiction of a highly forgettable era in Amercan history.  The characters are flimsy, the plot is circuitous and the endless stories of animal cruelty are downright depressing.  Perhaps the one saving grace is the author's use of Jacob's character as an elderly man who is looking back on his life with hindsight.  I cannot believe there has been such a fuss about this book and that someone was foolish enough to make it into a film.  Now that will be a real flop!  If I ever see this author's name again I will move away from it as quickly as I am able.  This was just a terrible book.",1
6,"After 2 hours of reading reviews, I am still amazed...","...that 155 people rated this as 5 star. I agree with every 1 and 2 star review: BORRRR-iiing. I have been reading for 50 years and only never finished 1 book. Now, 2. I hate this author's style of writing: pages of technobabble with scientific formulas that neither make sense to the lay reader, nor serve a purpose, followed by such minute details of irrelevant,stupid things like the page long description of the contents of a tool box. Then, there is the overuse and abuse of the word ""and"". The author must never have heard of the use of commas. All of the endless descriptions of the Martian surface being flat and dusty with the scattered rocks really helps my insomnia though. I only made it to Chapter 11, so I guess I never got far enough for all the political hoorah other reviewers referenced. I just didn't get it. I was hoping for a great story about colonizing a new world. What I got was the second worst book I have ever tried to read. I'm glad I didn't pay for this.",0
7,I don't get it...,"I was given this book by a friend that insisted that I read it, ""It was fabulous"".  I read about 100 pages of it and set it down which is something I rarely ever do.  A couple months go by and I was at a party where a couple people again said what a great book it was.  I decided I had to give it another try so I picked it back up and continued to read it.  At the end, I still don't understand the love of this book.  I didn't care for the animal brutality and I just never connected with the characters in this book.",1
8,A fun escape,"OK, it's not fine literature (so critics, would you please lighten up?), but it was lots of fun -- a glimpse into the era and life of the circus.  I honestly couldn't put it down and felt good when it ended.  Will this be on my list of all-time favorites?  No, but I appreciated the author's research into the topic; I learned something and enjoyed myself. What more could I want from a beach read?",0
9,Jacob's Wild Circus Story,"Sara Gruen spins a yarn, more than just a circus story, filled with memorable characters (not all human, some at a crucial crossroads), and highly dramatic events juxtaposed with the loneliness of old age. Near the end of his life, Jacob Jankowski finds himself reminiscing about his salad days, as painful as they might have been. He knows life is about the pleasure and the pain; you can't have one without the other (like good and evil). After a tragic loss, Jacob finds a home with a traveling circus as a veterinarian and along the way he: loses his virginity, makes some true friends, learns some valuable life lessons, and falls in love. But above all this book is about his grand love affair, how it began and how it will end. Oh, and there's an elephant named Rosie mixed in there too. I recommend this strongly. 4.5 stars.",0
10,the usual,"Or worse.  Well first of all she manages to add in at the end the usual whodunnit, with the criminal being the person most trusted.  Then there is the whole being in love with the Lynx.  I just didn't think that was  realistic at all. We didn't even have the comfort of a happy ever after  end. But I'm sure plenty of readers will disagree with me and think it was  a fantastic story.",0
11,Basically a Question of Taste,"On the simplest level, all I can say is that it didn't amuse me and I couldn't force myself to finish it. But I'm a ""hard sell"" for fiction, and I can see by the other reviews that many people loved it. Lucky them!On a slightly more analytic level, I'd say that what prevented me from enjoying the book was the ""voice"" of the narrator, who is supposed to be a man in his nineties remembering his youth in the circus. I'm a man approaching seventy, with some circus experiences as a teenager in Iowa and as the father of a circus acrobat in the Cirque de Soleil era. I found the ""voice"" of the narrator unconvincing, extremely unconvincing, as a male of the species and as a male American of the 1930s and 1940s. I couldn't get past that central implausibility. I found myself scoffing at the sensibilities of the pseudo-male narrator at every emotional turn of this quite melodramatic novel.",1
12,Over-rated. Not sure why this became a best-seller.,"This was a Book Club selection last year and our group of seven were looking forward to enjoying a recent best-seller. None of us liked it. I thought the story about circus life was interesting but I did not like any of the characters and although I tried, could not find a redeeming quality in any of them. I also did not care much for the writing style. Had it not been for Book Club, I would have quit a quarter of the way.",1
13,How many stars?!?!?!,"WOAH, I'm not sure why this book is so highly rated but I couldn't even continue reading it. Very draging and boring to me. Made it to chapter four and had to stop.",0
14,Don't Understand all the Hype,"I just finished reading this book tonight, and all I can say is that I do not understand what all the hype was about over the book/movie. I could not get into this book at all, and could not wait to finish it. If I wasn't the type of person that had to finish all the books I started, I would not have even bothered with this.",1
15,Trash,"I feel bad giving a one star review on this because the paperback is printed very well and it looks very high class.... but this one is all Hemingway's fault. I LOVE classic books. I am an avid reader and I read books by Faulkner, Proust, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Victor Hugo in my free time. I was not assigned this and actually, if anything, I set out predisposed to like this book; that said, there were very few good things about this book. If you want to learn more about the Spanish civil war, this book might be for you - but if you care about characters, plot or writing style, this book is destined to disappoint. I can't believe I'm saying this about someone whose name is synonomous with a writer (eg. &#34;I'm no Hemingway but...&#34;), but this book was poorly written.",1
16,"I'd actually like to rate it lower...too much hype, not enough detail...","Okay, first off, I had to think about this review long & hard before posting it.  Here goes...I feel cheated.  This book was so hyped up & I'm sure it had to do with the movie, which I refuse to see...but that's another story...I like the story.  I love the start & the end & for those that actually read the book...you know what I'm talking about.  For those that haven't read the book, I won't give it away.So what didn't I like?  SPOILER ALERT...stop here if you haven't read the book & plan to do so....I didn't like that the love story never really evolved.  It was just like Jake likes Marlena & she likes it...boom...now her husband knows they are in love.  WHAT?  When did that develop?  I needed more detail about their relationship & it just wasn't there.I did enjoy the history of the circus life & the life during the Depression.  I thought the Polish elephant was a riot.  I thought the old pictures from circus life back in this time period was a great addition to the book.But I really can't get over the story developement for Jake & Marlena.  Come on?  I can't be the only one who was expecting more on them??  Can I?Overall, the hype around this book was set too high.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.Guess I'll donate the book to the local library....",1
17,"Im only at chapter 8, so far it  is dissapointing!","After finishing a powerful and emotional novel like ""the Kite Runner"" i started to read ""water for elephants"". I am at chapter 8 and i am still hoping that this book will turn out to be better. Its written boring so far and the storyline is not making it any better. I know a lot of people will be shocked bout that comment, but i will continue reading and i hope that it will get better. So far its quite boring to me.UPDATE:Well i did finish this book and i dont know how this book got so many 5 star ratings?????? did i miss something? The whole story was BORING and I really didnt care to much for the main characters. The old man telling the story was a good Idea but at the end it was simply dissapointing.If you didint finish the book yet, then dont continue to read!From the first moment when he met August his wife we all knew what would happen.so that was not surprising at all.After reading and figuring out how august was acting up all the time it was also not hard to figure that he probbably had a mental problem. That was not surprising neither.I really wanted to like this book and i kept my word and finished it in the hope that it will get way better but .... no... this book is OVERRATED!",0
18,Strange !!!,"For a novel about a very dirty, ugly conflict in WWII - this book is strangely woven with a humorous thread. It could have been so much more - oh well.  Not recommended. Read Circus or Guns.",0
19,Slop,"Sara Gruen seems like a nice person. But this novel is total dreck. The structure reeks of baloney, the ""different"" characters are written with the same bland voice, and the whole melodramatic mess never rises above laughable soap operatics. I'd never want to take enjoyment of this kind of thing away from anyone, but if you've not read it, I'm sure there are better books about the circus out there for you.",0
20,Not really my cup of tea,"""Water for Elephants"" was the last Book Club selection I read, and It was not my choice. Reading it was a bit of a chore for me because upon reading a small synposis of it, I felt like I was back in high school. But like I did in school, I learned something.  I learned about what it is like to be in a circus, to know what drives someone to join a circus, especially in a different generation.  The main protagonist, Jacob Jankowksi, however, was a likable character and I liked his spunk.  Each chapter is narrated by the Old and young Jacob.  The old version would be looking back in time, thus, the next chapter would bring us to that exact moment in time when he joined, and when he met the woman he would fall in love with.  The writing at times, really didn't give me any feeling that I could not put this book down.  There is something about Ms. Gruen's writing that I just can't put into words other than: I didn't care for it, and I don't think she's a very good writer.I am a very open minded reader and am willing to try anything.  This is one book that I feel I wasted far too much time on.  I didn't even really finish it as I was still several chapters away from the end the night before our meeting.Take a look at my reviews to see some really wonderful books and see if you agree with me.Eileen F.",1
21,execrable elephant excrement,"My previous review disappeared, and even though it's been years since I read this garbage, I'm still so angry about the time and money wasted, I feel I must add my voice back into the mix.  I do remember being taken aback by brazen antisemitism that only one other reviewer referenced. I agree with every other 1 star reviewer and I tried to figure out how to give it 0 stars...",0
22,What's with the X-rated scenes?,"I've decided I just can't finish this book. The main character is a 23-year old male, but c'mon - I just don't appreciate some of the details the author is having him describe and they are totally unnecessary to the story. I've read almost nine chapters and decided I don't need any more images like the explicit strip scene, the details of a graphic ""8-pager"", and I certainly didn't need the picture of what the dwarf is doing alone on his cot while looking at the graphic magazine. It's a big disappointment because the story is actually interesting and I want to find out what happens but not badly enough to wade through the sludge. I don't think I've been this disappointed in a story since the ending of Angela's Ashes.",0
23,"A Little Less Water, Please","This is the type of novel I expect to be on the bestseller list and is why I typically overlook popular novels, sometimes to my own detriment. An elderly man, now in a nursing home, looks back on his time spent as a veterinarian in a circus. It's a story that could have been capable of more, but the plot seemed fairly predictable and the characters not that believable or rounded. It wasn't bad, mind you, I guess you could say this elephant was just too watered down.",0
24,"Read your Bible, not this book!","This man was a son of a pastor, but worshipped a profit, not God - Do your homework on him. The Bible is the truth. Don't be misled by what this book tells you.This quote is from Wikipedia - Thompson reported Gibran later saying that all the way through writing ""Jesus, the Son of Man"", he thought of `Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;. Years later, after the death of `Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;, at a viewing of a movie of `Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;, Gibran rose to talk and proclaimed in tears an exalted station of `Abdu'l-Bah&aacute; and left the event weeping.

25,Just wasn't for me.,I guess that this book was not for me. I download books if they seem interesting and get good reviews.  Well at least it was free because I thought it was incredibly boring.  Hopefully future readers will enjoy it more.,1
26,A long book that is ruined by endless repetition.,"A talented and praised writer he may well be but Kim is not up there with the greats of Science Fiction. He has an enviable ability to understand geology or even the current ideas about reaching Mars and forming a colony. However, it fast becomes background noise to the farcical political fantasy that populates Mars with nearly every ethnic group who are mostly viewed as quaint at best. There are many rocks and foreigners who behave like rocks: ""Dune"" on Mars this is not.Characters there are in plenty but must we endure their every identical step taken across Mars? A long journey into the heart of a geological dictionary does not make for great Science Fiction. Yes, its clever at times but too often it pulled my attention away from the larger narrative.Red Mars has its moments of beautiful prose. A frustrating book by a talented author who needed a strict editor.",1
27,Cotton Candy,"Why bother chiming in with review number 1,605? The verdict is in. Most readers (at least those who post reviews) love this book. Everybody who told me to read it (five or six reader friends) guaranteed enjoyment. I like those guarantees. Unfortunately, there's no such thing.Good things about ""Water for Elephants:"" Atmosphere Period detail (a rundown traveling circus from 1931) Old man's voiceNot so good things about ""Water for Elephants:"" Run-of-the-mill imagery. Examples: ""His eyes drill into Marlena. His temple pulses."" ""Flailing my arms like a windmill."" ""I blush so hard my scalp prickles.""  (Really?) ""The roustabouts, once roused, run about like headless chickens.""  The terrain is as ""dry as a bone."" ""I leave though every bone in my body screams against it."" There's not too much doubt about where the story is going, even from early on. We know Jacob will be successful, despite predictions he won't last a week. Tension is low throughout. Protracted scenes--such as Lucinda's funeral and the long strip-tease scene at the beginning. To what end? Perfect characters--too perfect. The sadistic hothead. The charming circus girl. Etc.In the end, the good things about the book were buried under the weight of the not-so-good. I left feeling like I'd been chewing on something tempting and sweet but ultimately unsatisfying, like cotton candy.",0
28,Thoroughly Mediocre--And Why is the Worst Character Jewish?,"like many others, i was disappointed by the dialogue and characters in this book. an embarrassingly poor effort.i also wondered by the author choose to emphatically make the only evil character jewish, when no one else's religion was even mentioned. what is with that? any ideas?",1
29,I'm in the minority again....,"It appears as though I'm in the minority once again.  All of us are entitled to our own thoughts and opinions but for the life of me I can't understand the number of 5 star ratings given to this book.  I'm not even sure I feel good about giving it a two.I wanted to like the book.  Really.  Who doesn't love a cute, little, old man telling his story of the good ol' days?  But as endearing as the concept was, I couldn't get past the fact that I honestly didn't care that much about any of the characters.  Sorry but it had to be said.  The characters were flat, the story was more fantasy than fiction and worst of all, the whole thing felt quite familiar.  It was only later that it occured to me that this story was trying very hard to be Fried Green Tomatoes and/or Driving Miss Daisy; the difference is that I actually cared about the characters in those stories.  Frankly, Water for Elephants read more like a screenplay than a great novel.For my friends, I would suggest:If you want a story of reflection - The Green Mile, Driving Miss Daisy, Fried Green TomatoesIf you want a story about elephants - Hannah's DreamIf you want a story about a circus - well, I've got no idea.  :)Having said all of that, I would like to see the movie.  As stated before, this read like a screenplay -- bare bones, generally just waiting for someone to bring life to the characters and story.",0
30,A bestseller? How is that possible?,"I agree with several other people who found it amazing that this is a bestseller. As an author whose books sell poorly right here on Amazon, I wish I knew her secret. I found it disgusting on so many levels, hard to follow, and in the end, just not worth reading. Perhaps something in the last third of the book would have changed my mind, but I couldn't finish it. I can't remember the last time I threw a book into the garbage can, but I looked it over carefully, thought about the very act of throwing out a book, and then dropped it into the trash. I don't regret it.",0
31,To far out for me,"This was a book club assignment, I had not wanted to read this book because I had heard that there was some animal cruelty but as a member I try to appreciate other peoples book choices as they do mine.The cruelty was a little hard to read, especially the beatings of Rosie but I also found myself cringing at the unneccessary sex scenes that were over the top, boredom at the constant threat of tossing people of the train and disbelief at the stampede of the menagerie.I did like the elderly Jacob and his life at the nursing home, I think it shows how elderly people are often ""put on the shelf"" when they become a bother in life...so sad.  Then this was spoilt by the idea that he ran away with the circus, was able to sell tickets even if he could not button his shirt and all with the acceptance of the current circus owner.I am sure the circus of that era was not a pleasant place but I think the characters could have been much better developed and the story a little less unbelievable.",0
32,Actually tossed it out,"While the science discussed in ""Red Mars"" is interesting in and of itself, the author goes on and on about it instead of sprinkling it throughout the text.  The result reads something more like a non-fiction description of how to get to Mars, settle there, design machinery for it, etc., but doesn't present a compelling story.  A compelling story is set up in Part I (Festival Night), which is all of 23 pages, but then Part II (The Voyage Out) rears its ugly, boring head.Part II introduces various characters on their way to Mars and not one of them seems especially intelligent nor highly regarded by his or her peers.  One guy, a Russian, goes around spouting philosophy and calling people names like ""idiot.""  In fact, he would have fit right in with those immature misfits relighting the sun in the movie ""Sunshine.""  After about 80 pages of ""going nowhere,"" I opted to pass on this version of Mars.  I'll also be giving the Green and Blue versions a miss.",0
33,"More like ""Treacle for Housewives""","Jacob Jankowski's parents perfunctorily die in the opening of this mawkish melodrama, and Jacob drops out of vet school and runs away to join the circus, where he finds fast work as a veterinarian for a menagerie of anthropomorphic animals. Jacob also finds romance (not with the animals), adventure and a real Snidely Whiplash of a villain. Sara Gruen copies the manipulative, crowd-pleasing instincts of Stephen King and Ron Howard without displaying any of the personality seen in those men's work. She writes in a bland, transparent, easy-to-read prose of cliche, predictability and cheap sentiment. This is the kind of book you can read in a single afternoon without ever having to pause to think. It goes down like a bag of circus cotton candy, and it's about as nourishing. Strictly LCD entertainment. It's like ""Titanic"" at the circus! It's like ""Seabiscuit"" with an elephant! After reading one of the most ludicrous endings ever written in the history of populist claptrap, I think I'm being more than generous with my two stars. To the critics who overpraised ""Water for Elephants,"" I offer this quote from the novel: ""Surely you can't all be happy with this ... this ... pap?""",0
34,Not for me,Am a big SiFi fan. I just couldn't get into this one. The pacing is slow and uneven. The beginning is confusing and I couldn't get beyond it.,1
35,Oh Please!,I couldn't read this book all the way through.  Using GD all the time and the main character lusting after a married women. YUCK!,0
36,"Profane, Graphic and Vulgar",I would have given this book no stars but that is not an option.This book is horrendous. I cannot imagine anyone with a lick of intelligence actually enjoying this trash. I threw it away after 25 pages.,0
37,CAUTION - PORN PARTS!!!,I really wish publishers would rate books like they do movies.  I got to the porn part and once again threw another book in the trash unfinished.  Problem is these books are good and the authors don't need to put the trashy parts in - they choose to.  Garbage in - Garbage out.  Guard your heart and your mind don't buy this book. Buy something else or wait for the PG version.,0
38,Too Graphic and Profane,"This is a disgusting book in my opinion. The author is way too graphic in descriptions, just not necessary. That and the profanity seems to be the basis for the book, no depth in it. Would not recommend.",0
39,Why Use the Cover From the HORRIBLE Film?,"The book is worthy of the praise it has received and its position on the Best Seller lists.  The film is a total travesty from screenplay to cast.Why trash the Kindle edition with a terrible cover? Even if no one sees the cover on their Kindle, viewing it online is a reminder of how badly Hollywood butchered the book.",0
40,Sad...to much animal abuse.,I did not like all the animal abuse.  It was just hard to read.  A very depressing story.,0
41,Gorey descriptions of animals being slaughtered,"I did NOT expect this graphic brutality when I bought this book; circus animals killed because of lack of food or just laziness on the part of the handlers. The story starts off in an engaging way, Jake the old man in the nursing home was entertaining. But there were too many instances of animals being abused/killed that I could not finish this book as it seemed to become the main focus. Too many animals in life are mistreated as it is and I do not need this information shoved in my face via a novel. This book should come with a warning to potential readers right on the front cover.",0
42,Not Vintage MacLean,"This is the weakest book of his I have read, and that is about thirty MacLean novels.  I understand that he passed away prior to this book being  published and that is was compiled posthumously.  While admittedly not all  of his books are great, I don't feel this is up to snuff with any of the  others.  Don't make this your first MacLean book and unless you feel the  desire to read every one of his books like I choose to, take a pass on it.  I am unwilling to touch any of the Alistair MacNeill books written using  MacLeans notecards because I feel those are apt to be pretty weak too, and  no one ever seems to duplicate the originals.  If you are going to give a  couple of MacLean novels a try, go for &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot;,  &quot;Puppet on a Chain&quot;, &quot;Bear Island&quot;, &amp; &quot;Ice  Station Zebra&quot;.",0
43,"nasty, could not finish","There should be a warning on books like this! With all the good reviews I thought it would be a good book, so I checked it out from my library. There are porn scenes in this book, so I stopped reading and returned it right away. I do not want to read stuff like that.",0
44,Repetitive and Boring but Well Researched,"I gave three descriptions in my title, that say it all, but the first two speak the loudest - this book is repetitive and boring.  The train rolls in, the train rolls out; in the old folk's facility Jacob is nothing but cranky and rude over and over again.  I truly don't understand how this book was picked up for publication.  I can more easily understand that it was made into a movie (even though I haven't seen it and after reading the book I probably won't), as I can imagine it is truly a spectacle with all of the color and magic of a circus.  And I will agree with other reviewers that it is well researched and the author does a good job portraying the post-depression times.  But that alone just doesn't carry the rest of the storyline, which is shallow and trite.  Among so many unaddressed issues - how is it that Jacob, an ivy league-educated young man, never looks back at what his life might have been after joining the low-lifes (mostly hobos, plus the entertainers) the circus attracts?  Certainly it's not to care for the animals, as you see him doing very little of that in the book.  At the end he wants to ""run away"" from the old folk's home and return to the only life he'd ever known - no surprise there - but it's a ridiculous proposition due to his age and I can't imagine anyone in the circus inviting him.  If you get nothing else from Uncle Al's character it is that he or any man in his position would be ruthless and cut loose anyone who didn't pull their weight, so what would a 90+ year old man do?  Certainly not water the elephants.",0
45,Don't waste your time,"I kept reading because I was hoping it would get better and redeem itself in the end, but it never did.  Rawness and grit do not substitute for depth.  I appreciated the accurate perspective of an elderly person.",0
46,tedious,"Life's a bitch and then you get old and it's worse and then you die.  That's all you need to know, which is a good thing because this novel has left me too depressed to write any more.",0
47,boring.....,"I couldn't finish the book I was so bored and I HATE leaving books unfinished. I didn't like the crudeness of it either, I just don't see why it was such a hit...... blah!",0
48,Just Too Boring,"I will admit, I usually would not write a review for a book if I do not finish it, however my feelings for this book are exactly why I never finished it.I first bought the book around three or four years ago and tried to read it then. I got about halfway through before it became too boring. More recently, I tried reading it again from the beginning and got less than halfway through.The main problem with Red Mars is that the author finds it necessary to put in an excruciatingly large amount of detail in everything. From describing procedures the astronauts use to descriptions of the Martian environment. A certain amount of detail is nice and helps create a vivid image, but I am not an astronaut-in-training so all the excessive technical detail should have been avoided.In my own opinion, pretty much every character in the book is annoying. I found some of them rather flat. They seem intent on talking politics (read: the author's political beliefs) or getting themselves into love triangles and wondering what went wrong. This does not help when the story shifts from one character to another when it is hard to like any of them.The book teeters on the edge of complete implausibility. I can believe the technology used to get the First Hundred to Mars, but the fun ends there. First, we are led to believe that space agencies would be so mind-blowingly incompetent as to send a bunch of under-qualified astronauts on a long-term mission to Mars. Later in the book (and I do not think I am spoiling much here), the colonists come up with a plan to use a bunch of wind-powered heaters to increase the overall temperature of Mars. Nonsense.I had hoped to read the entire trilogy as an epic story about colonizing and terraforming Mars. Instead I never made it more than halfway through the first book. If you want some real science fiction, go read some Clarke. This book did nothing for me.",0
