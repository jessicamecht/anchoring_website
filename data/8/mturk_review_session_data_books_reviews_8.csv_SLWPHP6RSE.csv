0,The Best Audio Production I've Yet Heard,"In my line of work, I have to drive a lot from school to school with trips taking anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour and a half. These Nine Hours of adventure, hobbits, men, dwarves, elves and Tom Bombadil, (yes, Tom Bombadil!) is a great way to pass the time. Unlike the Unabridged Reading where the casual listener can get bogged down in the misings of the reader (a production which should be given justice in a situation where you can give it your full attention), this exciting performance with a great cast of voices and well done music is just what the traveling listener needs. Gandalf, Sam, Frodo and Aragorn's voices have to be my favorites. Gollum and Gimli are a bit overdone but to interesting effect but they are all leagues better than the BBC version. I bought that first figuring that a British version would be the golden standard but Gollum just sounded like a normal guy who occasionally slurped or sucked his words and Gandalf sounded like a real loser. The Gandalf here speaks with authority as does Aragorn. Sam has just the right touch of innocence and Frodo never lets the listener down. All the major events of the books with the exception of Galadriel being tempted by the Ring are very well presented. What a sight for sore eyes (or ears I should say) was it to hear Tom Bombadil's merry voice, a favorite of fans and readers who never quite made it into any production at all of the series. The battles are all satisfying as is the climax in Mount Doom and the skirmish with Shelob. I recommend it for journeys long and short.",0
1,Couldn't get through it,"I'm afraid I could not get through this book.  I read the prologue and  first two chapters and put it down.  I rarely do that with a book.  It  wasn't making much sense to me.  It was somewhat of a downer and I like to  be entertained when I read.  Also I just don't like four letter words.  I  don't think authors have to use that language in their books.  Other books  by Anne Rivers Siddons are much, much better.",1
2,The 'Has It All' American Classic Novel,"How can anyone NOT give this book 5 stars?  I appreciated the foreword, preface, afterword, explanatory notes &amp; the notes about the author by Matthew J. Bruccoli which enlightened my eyes before I started on the path of reading The Great Gatsby.It's funny that somehow my high school English teacher skipped this as required reading for me in the mid to late seventies.  I bought the book for my niece, Ashley, a few years ago.  I remembered a co-worker, Kim, who was an avid reader who once told me that The Great Gatsby was her all-time favorite book.  I was curious.  It's strang that it took my 17 year old niece to 'get me on the bandwagon' to finally read this classic book at age forty-one.  It amazes me to realize that the author, F. Scott Fitzgerald, died at age forty-four in Southern California on December 21, 1940, believing himself a failure.It's quite clear that Fitzgerald's ideas may have been 'made up' but he sued real life people, his own experiences and other true events to make his story.In retrosprect, the novel contains a story of money, greed, love, deceit, suspense, hate, alcoholism, stress, passion, time, ambition, death, life, status, 'leaving a mark in life', pleasure, vacation, free time, heroes, lies, trust, women vs. men, the 1920s, mystery, intrigue, romance, poor vs. rich, Sundays in the park, art, happiness, choices, fashion, lust, loneliness, friendship, adventure, honesty, making conversation, scenic views, people, music, dance, avoidance, communication, observation, summer, intelligence, panic, forgetting, agin, laughter, family values, prejudice, jealousy, past, future, youth, tranquility, grief, responsibility, self-improvement, self-actualization, carelessness, escaping and living life.",0
3,It was just alright,I have no idea what the hoopla is about but I find this book to be just alright at best. It is a little slow. The characters didnt have any passion or oomph. It was just very blah to me. I do like Reese Witherspoon and Rob so maybe the movie will be more entertaining.,1
4,With so many BETTER books about the Tudor court...,"With so many BETTER books about the Tudor court available, why bother to read this flighty one that reads more like a cheap romance novel than historical fiction? The dialog is insipid; I don't need the characters to speak in authentic period dialog, but I do need them to sound like the intelligent and well educated courtiers they were. I haven't read any of Gregory's other work, but after starting with this book I won't be back. The best thing about the book is that it reads quickly and is over fast.",0
5,Top Ten Stupid Criminals,"""Mr. Paradise"" has its moments, like when the Top Ten Dumb Criminals list comes up, or when Kelly, the beautiful model, sees through Frank the homicide detective immediately, or when Frank tries to concentrate on the crimes he's investigating rather than on Kelly's beautiful body.And then, of course, is the whole idea of the ""almost"" twins play-acting as topless cheerleaders for Mr. Paradise. Or the flip of the coin by Paradise to see who gets which one. (Some TV show loves to depict women jumping on trampolines. Same appeal.)Leonard aficionados will expect the worst, and they'd be right. One chopped up body, cut in six parts by a chain saw. One bungled stock transaction. Three criminals, three shots at a ""business"" meeting. Enough blood and bungling for even the choosiest of Leonard critics. Good job, Elmore.Larry Rochelle, Author of the Palmer Morel Mystery Series"" BLUE ICE, CRACKED CRYSTALS, GULF GHOST, DEATH AND DEVOTION, BOURBON AND BLISS, TRACETRACKS.",0
6,George RR Martin makes a better George RR Martin,"In this round, Four transforms into a fourteen year old girl with a princess poster on his wall, Tris continues to have every awesome trait pounded away from her person, and hundreds of pages are dedicated to the same brain numbing sermon, bad science, and destruction of the word genetics. We get it. She's totally into sacrifice, and if someone isn't loudly martyred at the end, the book will only be 30% waterlogged with Christian propaganda.I saw the end of Season Five of Buffy. That was a pretty good hero-death sacrifice that broke my heart and blew my mind. I read the Game of the Thrones series. That was a great one with multiple first person narrators and incredible human sacrifice, building towards some ultimate greater good. Both of these series still have my heart. People are not angry because of the events of the ending; they are angry because the ending was pointless, the book is poorly written, and much of the big reveals are utter nonsense. This was just a mess from a writer perhaps pushed too hard by her publisher to finish something quickly, and as a result took every easy exit away from her loyal fans.",0
7,Exceedingly boring,"Wolfe Hall is written sumptuously, obviously the pen of a master.  However, the book is ultimately a tremendous (and confusing) bore.  I finally gave up at the half-way point, a rarity for this avid reader.",1
8,Awful,"Such sickness. I have no idea why i even downloaded it. The images made me sick to my stomach. I finished it only to see if there were any redemptive value in it. Although i feel sorry for Joe, i wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. I feel like i need to take a bath now.",0
