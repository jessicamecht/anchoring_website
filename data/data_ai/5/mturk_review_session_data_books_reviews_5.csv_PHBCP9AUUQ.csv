3,1076,"""Water for Elephants"" was the last Book Club selection I read, and It was not my choice. Reading it was a bit of a chore for me because upon reading a small synposis of it, I felt like I was back in high school. But like I did in school, I learned something.  I learned about what it is like to be in a circus, to know what drives someone to join a circus, especially in a different generation.  The main protagonist, Jacob Jankowksi, however, was a likable character and I liked his spunk.  Each chapter is narrated by the Old and young Jacob.  The old version would be looking back in time, thus, the next chapter would bring us to that exact moment in time when he joined, and when he met the woman he would fall in love with.  The writing at times, really didn't give me any feeling that I could not put this book down.  There is something about Ms. Gruen's writing that I just can't put into words other than: I didn't care for it, and I don't think she's a very good writer.I am a very open minded reader and am willing to try anything.  This is one book that I feel I wasted far too much time on.

I reckon those activities would have been more fun and fulfilling.This is a truly bad novel.  Truly bad.  The writing is amateurish, the dramatic tension poorly developed, the dialogue awful and the character development is shallow and one-dimensional.  I could not get over how stilted and poor the writing was.  Our newly orphaned hero, Jacob Jankowski, dropped out of Cornell before his final vet exam, jumped a train containing the Benzini Bros travelling circus, got taken on as the circus vet, instantly fell hopelessly in love with one of the married showgirls despite spending barely any time alone with her, took on a cookie-cutter baddie to boot (boo, hiss!) and survived to live happily ever after to a ripe old age.  So there's the plot outline, which initially showed some promise.  Pity Ms Gruen did very little with it that didn't come across as a below par submission to a Creative Writing 101 Workshop.  Probably one of the worst books I've read this decade.  Under no circumstances read this poor excuse for a novel.

If you are able to ignore those sorts of things, you will not find yourself feeling any kind of sympathy for the one-dimensional characters.

29,3344,"Flashman and the Redskins is quite amusing and does offer some interesting insights, and the book put me onto other more objective accounts, notably Cremony's ""Life among the Apaches"". But while I enjoy MacDonald, I find his tendency to overstate similarities between the vices of westerners and those who meet them, he is not willing to recognise the virtues of westerners and benefits they have brought to the rest of the world-of course his iconoclasm is part of a vogue that has persisted for close to 50 years. It must be close to its use by date.I also found MacDonald's labouring on Custer's neuroticism and childish temperamentalism excessive. I doubt he would have been made a brigadier in his 20's, or, after the Civil War, even been put in command of a battalion of cavalry, if he did not demonstrate maturity, leadership and strategic sensibility. MacDonald doesn't really give enough attention of the inferior quality of the weapons of the 7th cavalry compared to that of the Sioux and Cheyenne, and that Custer's detachment was outnumbered by up to 10 to 1.

I'd give it 0 stars if I could.I love epics, so I plodded through this trilogy, hoping it would get better, but it never did. I could sense that Robinson was extremely proud of the detailed world he created, but the story is horrible. The story unfolds glacially, with no sense of movement. Just when you think you might be getting attached to a character, he/she dies. Interesting story lines get dropped. There are long, long stretches where Robinson just describes everyday life, in excruciating, boring detail. There is no excitement or suspense, no character that grabs you. It's like some dull person's real life, full of routine, disappointment, and boredom. Robinson's typical character has a dream, begins to pursue it, getting you inspired, then gets killed or just gives up and joins the cause he was fighting.This was the worst science fiction I have ever read.

It was exceptionally well-written, and I enjoyed every page.We have a vet student joining a circus, with mistreated animals he's frantically trying to save and protect. We have a lovable elephant. The narrator is an old man looking back, and he recounts his tale in the immediacy of present tense as he describes situations that happened decades earlier. Interesting, and very effective choice, to write in present tense throughout.The ONLY thing that keeps me from giving the book five stars was the lack of character development for Marlena. Throughout the story I understood the protagonist loved her, but she seemed to be the woman tied to the railroad tracks throughout - Nell being constantly tormented by Snidely Whiplash - and I never really got a sense of her as a person. Maybe I missed it (not surprising - I read the book in daily spurts while I walked a treadmill), but I didn't even know how old she was. I got a much clearer picture of minor characters, like Rosemary, Kinko and Camel, than I ever did of her.I also never understood the whole ""water for elephants"" thing that the protagonist railed about in the beginning of the book.
