2,52416,"I'm a big fan of Lawhead's &quot;The Iron Lance&quot; and his &quot;Song of Albion&quot; series.  With high hopes, I purchased this historical novel.  My knowledge of St. Patrick is limited, and I looked forward to discovering more of his life and his spiritual influence in Ireland.&quot;Patrick: Son of Ireland&quot; does many things well.  The settings are believable and well-researched, the language fluid, and the dry details turned into fascinating tidbits.  I particularly enjoyed the Roman battle scenes and descriptions of the Plague.  Sobering stuff.  Succat, later known as Patrick, is a character with flaws and foibles, a man who grows slowly into the understanding of his calling.  And when Succat comes to a final point of humility and turning, Lawhead paints a succint and touching scene.  He employs Pelagius, who plays a minimal part in only the final thirty pages of the book, to address Succat: &quot;You have learned what a man can do in his own strength...Perhaps now it is time to learn what God can do with a man who knows the limits of his strength.&quot;Unfortunately, the book never allows us to see the result of this turning.  We witness years of futility in Succat's life, and, in fact, we ourselves grow weary of his attempts to escape slavery and of the deceits he thrusts upon even those he claims to love.  I appreciate that all this brings Succat to a medieval mid-life crisis, but I would've enjoyed seeing the working out of his newfound knowledge.  I even started to suspect that Lawhead would be throwing a sequel our way.  Instead, he throws us a bone--a prologue and epilogue that tidily skim over Patrick's years of hard spiritual work.I trod my way along the arduous trails of Succat's life, found some wisdom to be gained and some eventual rewards, but felt cheated by the blithe conclusion.  Am I missing a sequel, or is this all we get?",3 1/2 Stars...Am I Missing a Sequel?,3.0,1

4,51405,"Having read very few fantasy novels, I am not a proclaimed expert.  All I know is that I was soooo intrigued by this novel.  The dark underworld of the London subway made for a fas- cinating setting.  I loved each  character:  Richard Mayhew, Door, the Marquis de Carabas, Mr. Croup and Mr.  Vandemar.  The good ones were so good they made me ache, the bad ones were  so evil they made me shudder.  And then there were the ones you were never  sure of.  I cannot recall a book in which every scene was so vivid in my  imagination.  I have since bought everything I have been able to find by  Gaiman. Just finished Stardust, a wonderful tale of two worlds.  Looking  forward to Smoke and Mirrors and the Sandman collection.",My favorite book of l998,5.0,1
5,14142,"I bought this book because of the wonderful reviews and publicity it received.  YIKES!!!  Was I disappointed!  If Chabon had submitted any part of this book as a freshman English paper, he would have received an ""F"" for his diction.  The story was interesting and I did finish it, but the language was forced and jerky in its tempo.  It is a strange time to be a Jew ...or not...",A strange time indeed...,1.0,0
6,10500,"I know Mr. Sheldon has written a gazillion books, and I am certain that I once read one by him that I really liked, but I cannot remember which one, and it is MOST DEFINITELY not this one. This book is boring, slow-paced, and dull. Dana Evans, for one, starts out as a least likely mom type, which is how she is dropped into the plot, and true to form, turns out to be an awful Mom. Right away I didn't like her because of this and couldn't feel for her. She runs around the globe leaving her &quot;son&quot; with a lady she just met, but she does call once in awhile. Dana Evans' next sin is to tolerate the unheard of relationship between her fiance, Jeff, and his ex-wife, who just happens to be a perfect ten in every way. Dana questions in her mind, to her credit, but she sure is a whole lot more patient than any American woman I know. As Dana chases a murder story that winds up getting top government officials to tell her things that they have never told anyone (and this while she is a Star Reporter!), her son is first a troublemaker and then neglected at home. Nonetheless, our heroine plunges forth, reveals all, and there is a nice, homey, happy ending that - well, that left me nauseated. Don't waste your time on this one, I imagine Sidney Sheldon fans are pretty disappointed, because I would hate to think this is a sample of his work.",Lousy.,1.0,0

8,1296,"I gave three descriptions in my title, that say it all, but the first two speak the loudest - this book is repetitive and boring.  The train rolls in, the train rolls out; in the old folk's facility Jacob is nothing but cranky and rude over and over again.  I truly don't understand how this book was picked up for publication.  I can more easily understand that it was made into a movie (even though I haven't seen it and after reading the book I probably won't), as I can imagine it is truly a spectacle with all of the color and magic of a circus.  And I will agree with other reviewers that it is well researched and the author does a good job portraying the post-depression times.  But that alone just doesn't carry the rest of the storyline, which is shallow and trite.  Among so many unaddressed issues - how is it that Jacob, an ivy league-educated young man, never looks back at what his life might have been after joining the low-lifes (mostly hobos, plus the entertainers) the circus attracts?  Certainly it's not to care for the animals, as you see him doing very little of that in the book.  At the end he wants to ""run away"" from the old folk's home and return to the only life he'd ever known - no surprise there - but it's a ridiculous proposition due to his age and I can't imagine anyone in the circus inviting him.  If you get nothing else from Uncle Al's character it is that he or any man in his position would be ruthless and cut loose anyone who didn't pull their weight, so what would a 90+ year old man do?  Certainly not water the elephants.",Repetitive and Boring but Well Researched,1.0,0
9,33470,"Honestly, this is entirely due to the ending. I put up with some slow parts of the book, that's expected, but the way the books ends makes literally no sense. There were so many options, and it was like the author was hell bent on choosing one thing, when she had a plethora of choices.",Not Necessary,1.0,0
