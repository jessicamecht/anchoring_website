0,3100,"in for whom the bell tolls hemingway looks at war from the individuals perspective. his army is a rag tag group of guerrilla fighters, not the army. the time and setting is the spanish civil war. a general understanding of that war is helpful. the characters include mostly local insurgents and one american mercenary. the horrors of war are portrayed on both sides with neither having the higher moral ground.it is also a study of courage in the face of potential death. this is developed not only through the underlying theme of war, but the stories of some of the characters earlier lives which include bull fighting and the running of the bulls.the one drawback to the book is the stilted language used in the dialog of the novel (including the refusal to use obscenities).a book well worth the read",profiles in courage,4.0,0
1,54977,"In between books I planned to read, I picked up a copy of this in a second hand booksellers in Tokyo, without having heard of it and without a great deal of expectation. When I finished reading it the other day I felt that I had stumbled upon a little treasure of a book.The premise is fascinating - was there any reason, divine or otherwise, for the death of a group of five strangers who happened to be crossing a bridge when it suddenly collapsed in 18th century Peru. The structure is interesting, with five chapters devoted to the entertaining life stories of each of the victims, and at the end a touching conclusion about their deaths, and the nature of death itself. Thornton Wilder's prose is pleasantly masculine (without being macho), but embroidered with fine descriptions of character and place.The final paragraph, in which a wise old nun contemplates on the significance of the accident is among the tenderest and most moving pieces of writing one could hope for. All in all, a curious, haunting little gem of a book that is widely known in America but appears to have been overlooked in Britain. The whole book can be devoured in the space of two or three hours - and you will find them three hours well spent.","Curious, haunting and tender",5.0,1
2,52416,"I'm a big fan of Lawhead's &quot;The Iron Lance&quot; and his &quot;Song of Albion&quot; series.  With high hopes, I purchased this historical novel.  My knowledge of St. Patrick is limited, and I looked forward to discovering more of his life and his spiritual influence in Ireland.&quot;Patrick: Son of Ireland&quot; does many things well.  The settings are believable and well-researched, the language fluid, and the dry details turned into fascinating tidbits.  I particularly enjoyed the Roman battle scenes and descriptions of the Plague.  Sobering stuff.  Succat, later known as Patrick, is a character with flaws and foibles, a man who grows slowly into the understanding of his calling.  And when Succat comes to a final point of humility and turning, Lawhead paints a succint and touching scene.  He employs Pelagius, who plays a minimal part in only the final thirty pages of the book, to address Succat: &quot;You have learned what a man can do in his own strength...Perhaps now it is time to learn what God can do with a man who knows the limits of his strength.&quot;Unfortunately, the book never allows us to see the result of this turning.  We witness years of futility in Succat's life, and, in fact, we ourselves grow weary of his attempts to escape slavery and of the deceits he thrusts upon even those he claims to love.  I appreciate that all this brings Succat to a medieval mid-life crisis, but I would've enjoyed seeing the working out of his newfound knowledge.  I even started to suspect that Lawhead would be throwing a sequel our way.  Instead, he throws us a bone--a prologue and epilogue that tidily skim over Patrick's years of hard spiritual work.I trod my way along the arduous trails of Succat's life, found some wisdom to be gained and some eventual rewards, but felt cheated by the blithe conclusion.  Am I missing a sequel, or is this all we get?",3 1/2 Stars...Am I Missing a Sequel?,3.0,1

4,51405,"Having read very few fantasy novels, I am not a proclaimed expert.  All I know is that I was soooo intrigued by this novel.  The dark underworld of the London subway made for a fas- cinating setting.  I loved each  character:  Richard Mayhew, Door, the Marquis de Carabas, Mr. Croup and Mr.  Vandemar.  The good ones were so good they made me ache, the bad ones were  so evil they made me shudder.  And then there were the ones you were never  sure of.  I cannot recall a book in which every scene was so vivid in my  imagination.  I have since bought everything I have been able to find by  Gaiman. Just finished Stardust, a wonderful tale of two worlds.  Looking  forward to Smoke and Mirrors and the Sandman collection.",My favorite book of l998,5.0,1

I always enjoy returning to the 13th ,14th cn to revel in the magnificent descriptions and details offered in these novels. I highly recommend this series and this entry for those who enjoy historical action. They are not for everyone as my wife sees no value in the tales. But I see that as her loss. Any Bernard Cornwell is a delight to me and I have read them all I believe.Jack",A return to bygone eras.,5.0,1

7,16959,"I have only discovered Val McDermid in the past few months, and have been reading her Tony Hill/Carol Jordan books in order. I have just finished The Torment of Others and find myself increasingly impressed by her skill in plotting and characterization. Early in this book, McDermid throws us a red herring, that was clear. But she does a very good job of concealing the true villain, which I finally figured out just before it was revealed. Even then, things get very dicey, and a last minute discovery brings it all together.This is a story of power, sadism, perversion and brutal murder. McDermid pulls no punches and is not averse to killing off regular characters. It is not a cozy mystery, but readers familiar with the British TV series already know that. On one level, it is a slow unfolding of a relationship between two damaged people: Hill and Jordan. On another level, it is a brilliant and (as far as I know) grittily realistic police procedural; and on yet a third level, it is about the quest for justice and fairness in a world where the lines between good and evil have grown a bit blurred.I reserve five stars for truly exceptional books, and would award 4.5 if I could. Thanks, Ms. McDermid, for another complicated and suspenseful reading experience. I now move on to the next in the series.",So cleverly plotted...,4.0,1
