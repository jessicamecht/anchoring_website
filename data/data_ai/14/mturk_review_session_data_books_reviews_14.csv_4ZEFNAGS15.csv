1,5103,"This book series began strongly, and I was definitely hooked. I burned through the first three in probably less than 2 weeks. I love the genre, and the characters really grew on me. I wanted to know where they (and the realm) would end up.What I began noticing, however, was that George Martin's writing tends towards being a whole lot of words about nothing. No furtherance of major plot points. No grand character arcs, as those who you hold onto tightest end up being killed off for nothing. It gets to a point where you don't care about any of them anymore, because who knows a)what the overall PLOT of the book is, and b)who will even be around 5 chapters later.Gag me if I have to read 20 zillion more pages about extraneous scene descriptions. I ended up skipping pages at a time because they consisted entirely of descriptive fluff. What else made my eyes roll? All the ""turning his head and spat""s and ""bit his/her tongue so hard he/she tasted blood""s. Talk about repetitive literary tricks. It's the complete opposite of the word 'creative'. Martin's writing is cliche and tired.I feel as though I wasted my time and money with A Dance With Dragons. Absolutely nothing gets resolved; as it was in A Feast for Crows, only more questions are raised. I was a fan, but now I'm definitely a hater. Heed my review and save your money. That day/week/whatever of your life you spend reading this garbage, you will never be able to get back.",A Whole Lot of NOTHING,1.0,0
2,34717,"This book was a huge disappointment, and not just for the reasons everyone is saying.  The plot, the writing, the failure of the two narrators, and yes, the ending -- they all made this book horrible.  I am very disappointed and wish I had stopped at the second book.  I hope the movie changes not only the ending but the entire story because this revelation about genetic experiments is just plain stupid.  Epic fail times ten.",Allegiant = epic fail,1.0,0
3,27885,"What is great about this book, ""Lost in Shangri-La: A True Story of Survival, Adventure, and the Most Incredible Rescue Mission of World War II,"" is that it is non-fiction that reads like fiction.  I am a fiction junkie, and, sometimes, am turned off by nonfiction pieces.  They just don't hold my interest.For those readers who don't like to read non-fiction, as sometimes (unfortunately) it tends to be a bit boring, this book is for you.  The wonderful thing about fiction is that it enthralls the reader and wraps him/her up in the story. You lose time, and just wallow in the woven words.This book does the same, and has the benefit of being true.  The author, Mitchell Zuckoff, has written several non-fiction books, and after diving into this one, I'll be sure to check them out.I don't wish to rehash the plot or summarize the events (better reviewers than I already took care of that detail).  Instead, block out some time, and prepare for the journey back to 1945, to discover the improbable story of survival for yourself.  What's incredible is that this story was forgotten...forgotten by time and by man.  Rediscover it.  If you can order it via the Vine program, I recommend you do so, or wait until it is released later this year.  The pictures add so much to the story as well, and are situated throughout the entire text.Enjoy, folks.  You won't regret it.",Wonderful...what an awesome book!,5.0,1
4,49233,"I agree with another reviewer who felt that this book sets a tedious pace that is frequently bogged down by constantly rehashing the ups and downs of Henry's divorce trial, first from Catherine of Aragon's point of view and then Anne Boleyns. While the amount of material regarding Catherine of Aragon is enormous the writer does stop often to compliment himself (tasteless) and by the time Anne Boleyn comes on the scene the reader is exhausted.","In depth study of Henry's motivations, Catherine of Aragon",2.0,0
5,32170,"The first book is not perfect, but at least it is readable. This one is a big flop, which ensure me not to continue reading the next installment. This book, which is a sequel from Divergent, adds almost nothing to the first.First, the opening is lame. It jumps right into the story just like it is the next chapter of the last book. It does not give you some reminiscence from the previous book.And then the story. The plot is just about Tris making one stupid mistake continued with another stupid mistake, but turns out to be OK later. She is not a divergent to me, she is just the luckiest person, which never pay for the consequences (yes, her parent died, but she turns out to be OK anyway. She is not torn apart).And the character development, I can simply say: None. Tris stays being Tris, Tobias being Tobias. The writer also does not seem to be interested in giving her audience the raison d'tre of the act.One ingredient of any fantasy/sci-fi novel is the world development. She has done well in development in the first book, but somehow it stopped there.So no story, no character development, no world developmnet, equals to nothing.Sorry Veronica, you fail this one.",An unnecessary sequel,1.0,0

12,42113,"Well, I think Margaret Mitchell could have used a realy good editor.  I don't mind reading long books quite the contrary I assure you, but well, one tiers of hearing yet another story about Scarlett doing something or another that gets her scorned by the people so they gossipe and Melly has to stop them.  One time is enough!The story line for those few people who do not know it is the following:  The young Scarlett O'Hara who is the favorit of all men falls in love with her friend Ashely Wilks who marries his cousin Melanie (Melly).  Scarlett wants to hurt Ashley so she marrys his brother who soon after they are married dies in the war.  Then Scarlett earns the scorne of the populus of Atlanta with her scandales behavior.Melly has a painfull childbirth and Scarlett takes her to Tara (her home) as the Yankkees march into Atlanta Georga.  To Melly this kind act of careing for her wins her undieing respect.The story continues from here but I will not.  The rest of the book centers around Scarlett and Rhett Butler and their feelings towareds eachother.I do not want to give the wronge impression it is not a bad book or even a book I disliked, it was great to read on the nine hour plane flight fom Budapest, but, after the plane ride was over and I still had 300 pages left I felt like I was wadding through quick sand to fininsh.  If I had been on the plane for about 2 and a half more hours I would not feel this way but back home where I had so many other book to read I began to look at it as a waste of time.  I am glad however that I have read it.  Though I would have certenly looked at it in a more appeling light had it been hacked down about 300 pages.",Fiddle-de-dee,3.0,0

14,18210,"I was quite disappointed with the Constant Princess after having LOVED The Other Boleyn Girl and The Queens' Fool and having enjoyed The Virgin's Lover (although it wasn't as good as the previous two).What can be seen as a prequel to The Other Boleyn Girl, this novel tells the story of Catalina, Infanta of Spain, Princess of Wales as she moves to England from her beloved Spain to marry Prince Arthur and eventually become the Queen of England, her lifelong goal as we are so frequently reminded. The author breaks from her usual writing style to introduce Catalina's thoughts in the form of stream-of-consciousness rants which interrupt the third person storyteller every few pages or so. It is completely distracting and did nothing but take away from the telling of the story.What could have been an extremely riviting tale became boring and monotonous- pages upon pages described simply her idolization of her parents King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella and her ""especial relationship"" with her G-d which proved she was born to be Queen of England, despite what she had to go through to claim her title.Additionally, about 2/3 of the way through the novel it shifted from a love story/hardship story to a novel about plotting and waging a war, which was utterly boring and disjointed.I hope the author can return to the greatness of her prior novels (The Other Boleyn Girl, The Queens Fool).  If her subsequent novels are going the direction of this one, I will no longer be reading them.",Skip this one but definitely read her others...,1.0,0

16,46355,"I've read other accounts of the Bataan Death March and POW stories of those held in Japanese war camps. This is the first one that I truly didn't like. First, the book is extremely repetitive, about HIS torture, HIS ability to survive. Very little mention of others in camp with him. He is very full of himself - how positive his attitude was (and how those that died had bad attitudes), how he had a higher threshold of pain that another soldier. Well, that soldier happened to be experiencing what we now call waterboarding, and we now know NOBODY can sustain for more than a few minutes. How dare he?He was very negative about the military, and how they should have told the freed POWs not to eat so much because it would cause illness further down the road. How were they to know?Honestly, there are much better accounts of this that you will walk away with a feeling of inspiration rather than dislike of the writer. Ghost Soldiers happens to be one of them.",Skip it - he does a terrible disservice to other POWs,1.0,0

19,32010,"I wasn't the biggest fan of Divergent, but decided to continue with the series out of curiosity. I was less than pleased with Insurgent. While full of action and suspense, it was not always clear why certain actions were being taken. Tris was bouncing around from compound to compound throughout the novel, but in the end, I'm not sure half of that was necessary. The plot lacked continuity for me. The characters are nearly impossible to keep track of without taking notes of some sort. Almost all seemed to have originated from one faction and transferred to another, making it hard to remember who originated from where. Is it just me, or was faction switching made out to be more rare in Divergent? Suddenly all characters have switched factions. Throughout the novel, I found myself more annoyed by Tris than rooting for her. Half the time her logic was quite questionable as well. Needless to say, I was disappointed in Insurgent. Several times I contemplated shelving it for good. Perhaps it's meant for a more juvenile audience (I'm 22). I will not continue onto the third book, I've suffered enough.",Not a fan,1.0,0
