I must say that it is one of the worst books I have ever read and I have been an avid reader my entire life.  I couldn't relate or get attached to the main character, Jacob, except at certain points when he was elderly.  I actually felt very embarrassed for the author while reading the many squalor erotica scenes that did nothing to help me connect or care for any of the characters.  I was expecting a heartfelt romance, but the characters, including the love interest, Marlena, are so one dimensional that I found the whole thing absurd and unbelievable.  I kept trying to get into it and hoped it would get better as it went along, but no such luck.

6,276,"In ""An Apple a Day"" the McGill University professor Joe Schwarcz offers salient useful nutritional advice.  Eat lots of fruits and vegetables.  Meat is fine but make sure you have more whole grains on your plate.  Emphasize variety and balance in your diet.  Avoid processed foods, especially those high in fat, sugar, and salt.  Exercise.  There are no miracle foods and short cuts to a healthy diet.That's great advice that comes at page 353 of this 355-page book.  I have many issues with the structure of the book, the main being Dr. Schwarcz's decision to divide his book into easily digestible chapters tackling all the major food debates out there:  organic, genetically modified, detox, and so on.  It would have been a much better book if Dr. Schwarcz structured it around his main thesis:  that there are no short cuts to a healthy diet.Science has spent decades and billions of dollars analyzing the different components of food in the hope of distilling the magical qualities of apples and tomatoes, and selling it in a bottle.  There is no scientific basis for the overwhelming superiority of a certain vitamin, chemical, or nutritional supplement.  Quite the opposite:  eating or drinking too much of a good thing can be a bad thing.  Seeking balance, moderation, and variety in nutrition is the best and only path to good health.","Sound Argument, Badly Structured",2.0,1

12,973,"I thought this was an interesting read until the author decided to label the villian of the piece as a paranoid schizophrenic.  August was cruel, sadistic and had violent mood swings.  None of these are symptoms of schizophrenia.  He did not hear voices, have complicated delusions, or an inability to keep touch with reality.  Unlike most unmedicated schizophenics, August had no trouble  thinking rationally or logically, on the contrary, he was in charge of a large section of the circus and exhibited fine organizational skills!The writer could simply have portrayed her character, August, as a jealous, violent man but instead she chose to advance the false stigma that people with schizophrenia are horribly cruel and violent or that they have a ""split"" personality. If only Gruen had researched psychiatry as well as she had the circus.I work with people who suffer from this disease.  While, without medication the patients delusions might possibly, rarely, lead them to do something violent, it's usually in relationship to fear associated with a delusion -- thinking a person is really an alien from outerspace, for example.  Never the sort of cold-blooded violence August engaged in.  August always knew exactly who or what he was hurting.When medicated, people with schizophrenia are actually less likely to commit violent acts than the general population.It's truly a shame when a popular book spreads stigma in this manner, the negative ripple effects go on and on.",Paranoid Schizophrenic?

You must become so invested in the daily life and fate of the characters that you become more interested in what is happening on the page than what is going on in your life. At its sporadic best, this novel is a good read. The author has chosen an interesting world and time to write about and obviously done her homework. But homework is not enough. The great nagging problems however are she is neither a good nor original writer. Consequently the characters she has created are wooden and every third sentence out of their mouths is either predictable or a howling cliche. The characters themselves are comprised of one cliche after the other-- the good hearted innocent hero, the evil boss, the plucky sidekick (a dwarf, no less),the bewitching damsel in distress, the schizo villain who is mean to animals...

The general strike moreover is of value as a 'social myth', an article of faith which inspires the workers in their struggle. For Sorel, social myths are important since they are 'not descriptions of things, but expression of a determination to act'. Although he later influenced Lenin, Mussolini and Action Franaise, he did not object to acknowledging himself an anarchist since 'Parliamentary Socialism professes a contempt for morality' and the new  ethic of the producers.""Mr Marshall, as a historian of anarchism, seems to share their indifference to facts.Sorel did not influence Lenin. Lenin called Sorel `the well-known advocate of confusion'. The Marxist historian of philosophy George Lukacs referred to Sorel's `totally insubstantial theory of myth'.

The main character is a veterinarian student who drops school, joins a circus during the Depression-era, finds love, hate and whatever may crosses his way.The lessons he learns are so valuable that decades later, living in a home for old people, he can still perfectly recall them - and pass them along. He is Jacob, a strange figure, who is no longer an alien when he runs into people even stranger than him.

On the other hand, Gruen's heavy-handed prose lacks the sparkling that would enhance ""Water for elephants"". Her storytelling abilities are more focused in the tell - when it should be the showing - missing the chance of creating a whimsical story.
