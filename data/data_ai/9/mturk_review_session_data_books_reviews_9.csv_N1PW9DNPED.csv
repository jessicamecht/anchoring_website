It covers a fascinating aspect of US history as it traces Seabiscuit's future owner, trainer and jockey from the early 1900's through the depression. The prose is rich and clear; the races are exciting; the horse has a big heart and a personality you'll never forget. Don't miss this one. And never fear, you do not need to be a horse racing fan to love this book.",Terrific book,5.0,1
1,6946,"This book does have some worthy insights, however the author tends to pigeonhole people into oversimplified categories according to the ""games"" they play to get their needs met.  In real life however, I think people are more likely to fall into various roles, or games, at different times in their lives. Something about the presentation seemed just a little pretentious, too. The author sometimes appeared to think he was giving away some secret bits of information, heretofore known only by him or a few select others.  This left a bad taste in my mouth.  Nonetheless, some of the information presented was very valid, and at the very least the book serves as an excellent reminder that we are all afraid of rejection, no matter who we are.  But we are not all ""losers"", in spite of the games we play; I don't think the author gives enough emphasis to this fact.  In addition, I think that sometimes life is just what it is, and looking at it like it is some kind of game is of no useful value whatsoever.  Watch out if you think you are having some kind of ""aha!"" experience, as it will be short-lived.",Worth giving a look,3.0,1
2,6158,Have tried several of the recipes - always good.  Have gifted the book twice with a waffle maker and a couple of utensils - great shower gift.  Biggest reason for me to own it - display it front and center of my cookbook collection.  It is attractive and very small - a great addition with fabulous pictures to accompany delicious recipes.,Great recipes and attractive to display.,5.0,0
3,3528,There aren't many public school novels being written and read these days. Rowling's Potter series is an exception (and in my opinion they are not all that good). However if you are old enough to have read Tom Brown's Schooldays then the Flaashman series may be of interest. If you have enjoyed Kipling's Indian stories then Flashman is also worth a try.,For kiplomaniacs,5.0,1
4,48789,"I hated this book.  I can't think of a nicer way to put it.  The author completely changes the plot of JANE EYRE, and to change the plot of the original is a total no-no.  I am surprised that anyone published this monstrosity.  If I could give zero stars, I would.  None of the characters remain true to the way Bronte depicted them, and I believe she would be sickened by what Emma Tennant did to her novel.  I only finished it to see how much worse it would get, and believe me, it got a lot worse before it was over.",Absolutely Hideous,1.0,1
5,32658,I could not wait to start reading this book!  The first one left me wanting more.  This book does not disappoint.  It is an absolute page turner.  I got lost in the story and too soon I wad finished with the book.  Looking forward to the release of the next one.,Page Turner,4.0,0

What fun it was being inside this book and living out the adventures and missteps along the way!  A fun summer read, 4 stars!","movie, please!!!!",4.0,0
7,8293,"Since I only read 50 pages, I'm not sure that it is fair for me to review, but I have read some very long books and enjoyed them.  This book is NOWHERE after 50 pages, and it was painful to even get that far.  Each character is described in excruciating detail - not by actions, but simply by words and their own thoughts.  This really helped me to appreciate authors like Terry Brooks and Terry Goodkind who can describe characters as the story grows, so that something is happening as you read.  After all, it is our actions that define us...",Ssssllllloooowwww starting,2.0,1
8,14170,"I have long been a fan of Michael Chabon's work.  ""Kavalier and Klay"" is one of my favorite contemporary novels.  I also loved the idea for ""Yiddish Policeman's Union"", a temporary Jewish homeland in Alaska.  Sadly, after I finished the last page I was very disappointed and wondered if he struggled mightily and rushed the novel out to print.  I think it's a third draft of a novel that he needed another draft or two to make it work.The best thing about the book is the way he fleshes out Sitka with the politics, economics, language and culture.  I was able to believe this place could exist.  The worst thing about the book is his main character, Landsman who I didn't find compelling, believable, or likeable.  Add to that is the problem of an inconsistent voice and occasionally confusing point of view.  One of the keys to detective fiction is voice and point of view.  If those aren't strong, then no matter how well you describe the backdrop to the story, it  loses credibility because reader doesn't commit to the character who acts as a guide to that world.The only character that came across as palpably real was the murdered victim who re-emerges later in an awkward flash back.  In only a few paragraphs, he comes across as a character I could follow through this book and who could bring it to life.Despite my disappointment, I'm glad that Chabon risks failure, stretches beyond his talent because that will only make him a better writer.  He hasn't written his masterpiece.  I'm sure that's yet to come.",A Courageous Misfire,2.0,1
9,48987,"I disliked the whiplash this book gave me. It's like author was on speed trying to cover Boston, prion, Tampa, Cuba in one hook. Along with social instabilities and sociopathic gangsters we Cuban tobacco farms, war ships. Ridiculous plot. Author should stick to writing about Patrick.",the most ridiculous Forrest Gump saga I've read.,1.0,0
