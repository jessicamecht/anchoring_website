1,21314,"Joe first I would like to say u are very brave.  So many times I thought as I read please let your torture be over.  Bravery doesn't even describe how I felt u made it through everything.  I always think about those who hide and lash out for the wrong they've endured.  I am so sorry for you not getting support in the Times you needed.  My question is why didn't your dads sister or Marie ever follow up on checking on you.  It seems like they gave up to soon as well. Why?  To me I find myself telling my sibling's that family is everything to me, if we don't have it what are we here for?  I have the utmost respect for people who have endeared what you have went through.",My heart bleeds for your injustice!,5.0,0
2,37080,"A Game Of thrones was a fantastic book. While I didn't like A Clash Of Kings, it was still an okay book. A Storm Of Swords is one of the best fantasy books ever written. So what happened? GRRM is a good writer. He may make mistakes, and he may over describe things at times, but he's a good writer nonetheless. ................ So why does this book (And the fifth book) SUCK? I don't know. But It's awful. I don't really know what I can say that hasn't been said, so I'm just going to finish the review now.",The downfall of the series,1.0,0

4,51405,"Having read very few fantasy novels, I am not a proclaimed expert.  All I know is that I was soooo intrigued by this novel.  The dark underworld of the London subway made for a fas- cinating setting.  I loved each  character:  Richard Mayhew, Door, the Marquis de Carabas, Mr. Croup and Mr.  Vandemar.  The good ones were so good they made me ache, the bad ones were  so evil they made me shudder.  And then there were the ones you were never  sure of.  I cannot recall a book in which every scene was so vivid in my  imagination.  I have since bought everything I have been able to find by  Gaiman. Just finished Stardust, a wonderful tale of two worlds.  Looking  forward to Smoke and Mirrors and the Sandman collection.",My favorite book of l998,5.0,1
5,28774,"Death of Kings is another great Cornwell novel full of historic references and depictions. I always enjoy returning to the 13th ,14th cn to revel in the magnificent descriptions and details offered in these novels. I highly recommend this series and this entry for those who enjoy historical action. They are not for everyone as my wife sees no value in the tales. But I see that as her loss. Any Bernard Cornwell is a delight to me and I have read them all I believe.Jack",A return to bygone eras.,5.0,1
6,59894,"I have been baking for longer than I care to admit, but I thought I'd give this book a try. Recently I made the hamantaschen, and as I was mixing the dough, I kept thinking that the proportions of ingredients in the recipe was wrong. Generally I try a recipe as written the first time around, though, and then decide whether to keep, tweak, or toss. This one falls into the last category. The dough was so short it was almost impossible to work with. Also, the recipe calls for using a 2 1/2 to 3"" cutter, but the number of pastries is based on a 2"" cutter. With a three inch cutter, the cookies came out teeny by the time they were shaped into traditional hamantaschen. They don't spread at all, so I wound up with cocktail sized pastries. They taste OK, but nothing special and although the apricot filling was good, it's kind of a no-brainer. Guess this one will go into the library book sale donation bin!",were these recipes tested?,1.0,0
7,34297,"I was really looking forward to this book, I pre-ordered it all the way back in May, but it was really not on par with the other two.  Like other reviewers have said, the dual POV was poorly done.  I couldn't tell which character was speaking and about halfway through I decided I didn't care anymore.  The revelation about what the divergent actually are was kind of a let down.  The factions being a form of behavior modification was not explained well and didn't make sense to me.  It was a weak explanation of how the world of factions that existed in the first two books could come to be.  And most of all I don't think killing Tris was necessary or a good idea.  I think the situation in reverse would have been better.  The plan being for Tris to go in and set off the memory serum becuase she had a chance of survival and then at the last minute Caleb stepping in and sacrificing himself.  We already knew Tris would sacrifice herself for others, she did it several times in the previous books.  It also might have shown that the GDs weren't so damaged after all.The book was bad enough and the ending shocking enough that I actually wondered if the author did it on purpose.  A lot of people are saying that they won't go watch the movie now, and I'm wondering if that was the point.",Bad...just bad,1.0,0
